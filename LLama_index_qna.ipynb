The universe is everything. It includes all of space, matter, energy, time, and you. NASA’s Astrophysics Division is dedicated to exploring the universe, pushing the boundaries of what is known of the cosmos, and sharing its discoveries with the world. The Division continues expanding humanity’s understanding of how the universe began and evolved, how it works, and whether there are places beyond Earth where life might thrive. By working together with collaborators and academic partners from all over the world, NASA researchers are making progress towards addressing these tantalizing scientific goals with leading-edge technologies and groundbreaking science. How does the universe work? Probe the origin and destiny of our universe, including the nature of black holes, dark energy, dark matter and gravity. How did we get here? Explore the origin and evolution of the galaxies, stars and planets that make up our universe. Are we alone? Discover and study planets around other stars, and explore whether they could harbor life. Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 (Astro2020) The National Academies have completed their work on the 2020 Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics. Please visit the National Academies Decadal Survey on Astronomy and Astrophysics 2020 web page for additional information about survey and their published documents on the topic. Learn More Current Programs Astrophysics comprises of three focused and two cross-cutting programs. These focused programs provide an intellectual framework for advancing science and conducting strategic planning. Physics of the Cosmos Cosmic Origins Exoplanet Exploration Astrophysics Explorer Program Astrophysics Research Featured Missions James Webb Space Telescope Webb is celebrating one year of incredible discoveries, from exoplanets to the early Universe. Read More Hubble Space Telescope Since its 1990 launch, the Hubble Space Telescope has changed our fundamental understanding of the universe. Read More Roman Space Telescope Roman is designed to settle essential questions in the areas of dark energy, exoplanets, and infrared astrophysics. Read More Current Missions The Astrophysics current missions include two of the Great Observatories originally planned in the 1980s and launched over the past 30 years. The current suite of operational missions include the Hubble Space Telescope , the Chandra X-ray Observatory , and the James Webb Space Telescope . Additionally, the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope explores the high-energy end of the spectrum. Innovative Explorer missions, such as the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory , NuSTAR , TESS , and IXPE , as well as NICER , complement the Astrophysics strategic missions. SOFIA , an airborne observatory for infrared astronomy, is in its extended mission phase. All of the missions together account for much of humanity's accumulated knowledge of the heavens. Many of these missions have achieved their prime science goals, but continue to produce spectacular results in their extended operations. NASA-funded investigators also participate in observations, data analysis and developed instruments for the astrophysics missions of our international partners, including ESA's XMM-Newton . Near Future The near future will be dominated by several missions. Currently in development, are ESA's Euclid mission which will fly NASA furnished detectors and JAXA's XRISM (X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy) mission which uses NASA furnished technologies that will help provide breakthroughs in the study of structure formation of the universe, outflows from galaxy nuclei, and dark matter. Completing the missions in development, supporting the operational missions, and funding the research and analysis programs will consume most of the Astrophysics Division resources. In October 2021, NASA selected a new Explorer Mission, the gamma-ray telescope COSI (Compton Spectrometer and Imager).  COSI will study the recent history of star birth, star death, and the formation of chemical elements in the Milky Way. In March 2017, NASA selected the Explorer Mission of Opportunity GUSTO (Galactic/Extragalactic ULDB Spectroscopic Terahertz Observatory) to measure emissions from the interstellar medium to help scientists determine the life cycle of interstellar gas in our Milky Way, witness the formation and destruction of star-forming clouds, and understand the dynamics and gas flow in the vicinity of the center of our galaxy. In February 2016, NASA formally started the top Astro2010 decadal recommendation, the Wide Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST). In spring of 2020, WFIRST was renamed the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope. Roman will aid researchers in their efforts to unravel the secrets of dark energy and dark matter, and explore the evolution of the cosmos. It will also discover new worlds outside our solar system and advance the search for worlds that could be suitable for life. The Future Since the 2001 decadal survey, the way the universe is viewed has changed dramatically. More than 3800 planets have been discovered orbiting distant stars. Black holes are now known to be present at the center of most galaxies, including the Milky Way galaxy. The age, size and shape of the universe have been mapped based on the primordial radiation left by the big bang. And it has been learned that most of the matter in the universe is dark and invisible, and the universe is not only expanding, but accelerating in an unexpected way. For the long term future, the Astrophysics goals will be guided based on the results of the 2020 Decadal survey Pathways to Discovery in Astronomy and Astrophysics for the 2020s . It identifies the most compelling science goals and presents an ambitious program of ground- and space-based activities for future investment. The report recommends critical near-term actions to support the foundations of the profession as well as the technologies and tools needed to carry out the science. In 2012 the Astrophysics Implementation Plan was released which describes the activities currently being undertaken in response to the decadal survey recommendations within the current budgetary constraints. The plan was updated in 2014, 2016, and in 2018. The Astrophysics roadmap Enduring Quests, Daring Visions was developed by a task force of the Astrophysics Subcommittee (APS) in 2013. The Roadmap presents a 30-year vision for astrophysics using the most recent decadal survey as the starting point.

In ancient times, the solar system’s small bodies—\\nasteroids and comets—were sometimes seen as ill omens, warnings from \\nthe gods. In modern times, they’ve come to be seen as the solar system’s \\nrubble, leftovers from its formation, but still largely ignored until the late \\n20th century. Increasingly, they’ve been seen by scientists as objects worthy \\nof study; by the general public, and the US government, as potential threats \\nto be mitigated; and by space advocates as future resources. This book tells \\nthe story of those re-interpretations and NASA’s role in them” –Provided \\nby publisher. \\nIdentifiers:  LCCN 2021035177 (print) | LCCN 2021035178 (ebook) | ISBN \\n9781626830684 (paperback) | ISBN 9781626830691 (Adobe pdf) \\nSubjects:  LCSH: Near-Earth objects–Research. | Near-earth asteroids–Research. \\n| Collisions (Astrophysics)–Research. | Asteroids–Collisions with Earth. \\n| Comets–Collisions with Earth. | Impact craters–History. | Astronomy–\\nHistory. | Hazard mitigation–International cooperation. | United States. \\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration–Research. \\nClassification: LCC QB651.C66 2022 (print) | LCC QB651 (ebook) | DDC \\n523.44–dc23/eng/20211209 | SUDOC NAS 1.21:2022-4235 \\nLC record available at https://lccn.loc.gov/2021035177\\nLC ebook record available at https://lccn.loc.gov/2021035178\\nThis publication is available as a free download at  \\nhttp://www.nasa.gov/ebooks .\\n9781626 83069190000ISBN 978-1-62683-069-1', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='1a48bce7-045a-48ea-8595-4793b9efcd95', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': 'v', 'file_name': 'a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4556385, 'creation_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_accessed_date': '2023-12-25'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, hash='59dbde44d7012c00324f9663bc6e1dd4c0d346a4eb5551299c701d4fa60c0c3a', text='v\\nCONTENTS\\nAcknowledgments vii\\nList of Figures and T ables ix\\n  Introduction 1\\n CHAPTER 1  Small Solar System Bodies Before the 20th Century 13\\n CHAPTER 2  Recognizing Impact as a Geological Process 31\\n CHAPTER 3  Finding and Characterizing Near-Earth Objects Through 1990 51\\n CHAPTER 4  Cosmic Impacts and Life on Earth 79\\n CHAPTER 5  Recognizing Cosmic Hazard 105\\n CHAPTER 6  Automating Near-Earth Object Astronomy 141\\n CHAPTER 7  Studying the Rubble of the Solar System 175\\n CHAPTER 8  Impacts as Natural Hazards 213\\n CHAPTER 9  Asteroids as Steppingstones and Resources 245\\n CHAPTER 10  Organizing Planetary Defense 273\\n CHAPTER 11  Conclusion 307\\nAppendix 1  \\nAsteroid and Comet Designations, Numbers, and Names 317\\nAppendix 2  \\nHeliocentric Orbit Classifications for Near-Earth Objects 321\\nGlossary 325\\nAcronyms and Abbreviations 329\\nSelect Bibliography 335\\nAbout the Authors 343\\nThe NASA History Series 345\\nIndex 361', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='5eef15bf-ccd3-4e89-84cd-f572d22df8c3', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': 'vi', 'file_name': 'a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4556385, 'creation_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_accessed_date': '2023-12-25'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, hash='63cdbe2d8d5fe8fff9f9537fa1444db46d4d73fd9f7c884f90922e293fe29c3b', text='', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='c372201d-824d-4611-961f-4b741526b009', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': 'vii', 'file_name': 'a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4556385, 'creation_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_accessed_date': '2023-12-25'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, hash='9bdc029b75cfca5fc247ae2f32a2700048cf7c2e478f6186058968108419e8f4', text='vii\\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\\nThis history was funded by the Planetary Defense Coordination Office at \\nNASA Headquarters, via a task order to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory \\n(JPL). The requirement was to produce a manuscript in two years, and to \\nmanage that, Erik Conway asked Meg Rosenburg, who had previously done \\nresearch on impact science, and Don Yeomans, who was a central player in \\nthe development of NASA’s Near-Earth Object (NEO) research programs, \\nto coauthor this work. In our original schema, Rosenburg was to write two \\nchapters on the history of impact science and on impact mitigation research; \\nYeomans was to write chapters on premodern and modern NEO discovery \\nand modern characterization research; and Conway was to write chapters on \\nmodern search systems, automation, and policy development. However, after \\na number of rounds of reviews and revisions, there is no longer a simple way \\nto map chapter to author.\\nIn addition to the more than 40 interviewees, who selflessly provided \\ntheir remembrances and insights, we’d like to thank David Morrison, Clark \\nChapman, Andrew Butrica, Rob Landis, Kelly Fast, Lindley Johnson, Steve \\nGarber, James Anderson, Brian Odom, and the NASA History Division’s \\nanonymous reviewers for their thorough reviews and extensive comments on \\nvarious iterations of this manuscript. We are indebted to the NASA History \\nDivision’s former archivists, Robyn Rodgers, Liz Suckow, and Colin Fries, for \\nresearch support. Molly Stothert-Maurer and Rachel Castro of the University \\nof Arizona’s Special Collections provided access to Tom Gehrels’s papers. \\nAt the JPL library, Mickey Honchell provided considerable interlibrary loan \\nsupport. Robert McMillan of SpaceWatch contributed documents and an \\nextensive set of interviews during Conway’s research visit to Tucson. Steven \\nLarson of the Catalina Sky Survey (CSS) gave a very informative tour of \\nthe survey’s observatories as well as interviews on CSS’s origin. Nick Kaiser, \\nRichard Wainscoat, and David Tholen of the University of Hawai’i Institute \\nfor Astronomy were particularly helpful during Conway’s visit there.

Yeomans’s interview with Ed Tagliaferi pro -\\nvided insights into the initial congressional interest in NEOs as well as the \\nlittle-known Earth orbital observations of atmospheric impacts by detectors \\ndesigned to monitor nuclear weapons\\xa0testing.\\nYeomans provided documents and journals from his career for this work, \\nas did JPL’s Paul Chodas, Alan W. Harris, Kenneth Lawrence, and Amy \\nMainzer. In addition to providing five oral interviews, Lindley Johnson of \\nNASA Headquarters gave Conway access to his files and to material turned \\nover to him by his predecessor, Tom Morgan of Goddard Space Flight Center.\\nSeveral online documentation efforts are worth calling attention to. The \\npersonal home page of Clark Chapman of the Southwest Research Institute \\ncontains numerous documents and essays reflecting his own career and the \\ngrowth of NEO astronomy. The National Space Society’s online document \\nlibrary was invaluable for digital scans of some older documents. The NASA \\nPlanetary Defense Coordination Office maintains an online document library, \\nthough because it is a new office, the collection is biased toward the recent. \\nNASA’s Small Bodies Assessment Group maintains a public document col -\\nlection and places all of its meeting agendas, minutes, and recommendations \\nonline too. It is an excellent example of public disclosure and governance. \\nReaders of this history will also see frequent references to the International \\nAstronomical Union’s Minor Planet Center website and JPL’s Center for Near-\\nEarth Object Studies website, both of which contain valuable information \\nabout NEOs and NEO research.\\nMany thanks to the outstanding production team in the Communications \\nSupport Services Center (CSSC).

Built on \\nthe foundation of NASA’s older Near-Earth Objects Observations Program, \\nthis new organization is intended to continue funding and coordinating ongo -\\ning search and research efforts for near-Earth objects (generally short-handed \\nas “NEOs”), identify strategies to reduce the risk of future large impacts by \\nNEOs (called “mitigation”), and coordinate emergency response actions with \\nother federal agencies and international partners. The new office’s initial bud -\\nget was set at $40 million per year, up from about $4 million in\\xa02010.1\\nA number of highly public recent events preceded this action. Most promi -\\nnently, an object about 20 meters in diameter had impacted Earth’s atmo -\\nsphere and exploded at an altitude of about 23 kilometers near the Russian \\ncity of Chelyabinsk on 15 February 2013, releasing the energy equivalent of \\nabout 500 kilotons of TNT. The explosion was high enough above the surface \\nthat it did only modest structural damage, but even so, there were over 1,500 \\ninjuries, mostly from glass shattered by the violent shock wave initiated in the \\nblast. By chance, the fireball was recorded on dashboard cameras installed \\nby Russian citizens to record accidents and police encounters, resulting in an \\nunprecedented circumstance: unlike every other known NEO impact, the \\nChelyabinsk airburst was a visual event that could be widely shared—and \\nbroadcast worldwide.2\\n1.

Because of this, Ptolemy remained a central authority in astron -\\nomy until the Renaissance.\\nPtolemy’s Almagest  did not include comets because he, like the influen -\\ntial Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322 BC) before him, did not consider \\nthem heavenly bodies. Aristotle had considered them emanations arising from \\nEarth itself, while Ptolemy only mentioned comets once, in his astrological \\nwork, the Tetrabiblos . In this work, he described in some detail how one could \\n“read” the omen represented by a comet’s apparition: its position with respect \\nto the Sun indicated the timing of the coming disaster, while its tail noted the \\nlocation. The shape of the comet was supposed to foretell the nature of the \\ndisaster.5 The Tetrabiblos  was just as influential as the Almagest , though in a \\ndifferent way: it was embedded in Catholic theology during the many centu -\\nries of the European Middle Ages.\\nIf classical astronomy can be seen as an effort to understand and predict the \\nmotions of heavenly bodies, classical astrology can be interpreted as astron -\\nomers’ efforts to predict the influence of those bodies on humans and on \\nhuman events. Ptolemy was not alone in practicing astronomy and astrology \\nsimultaneously (though he placed them in different books); most astronomers \\nprior to the modern era made their livings as astrologers. Society’s wealthier \\nmembers were much more interested in predictions relevant to everyday life \\nthan they were in the mere motion of the heavens. This was equally true in \\nancient China, where court astronomers had been making detailed observa -\\ntions of the heavens, and of comets, for centuries before the Almagest in order \\nto provide astrological advice to their rulers.6\\nFinally, it is important to note that while premodern civilizations saw com -\\nets as omens of ill fortune, they did not see comets as the cause  of that ill \\nfortune. Fickle, or vengeful, gods and goddesses were the actual agents of \\ndestruction; comets were merely warnings.\\nThe Almagest ’s influence gradually broke down among Western astrono -\\nmers during the 17th century, rooted as it was in the failing notion of geo -\\ncentrism.

The 1618 comet was the first to be observed with a telescope, \\nand astronomers began to understand them as physical objects, rather than \\nas omens sent by deities. But comets were also not quite fully accepted as \\npermanent features of the cosmos. Johannes Kepler, who in this era demon -\\nstrated that planetary orbits were calculable as ellipses, believed comets were \\nephemeral and moved in straight lines. Other period astronomers believed \\nthem eternal, moving in orbits, though not necessarily centered on the Sun.\\nEdmond Halley’s 1705 treatise on comets began to solidify elite opinion \\naround the idea that at least some comets were repeat visitors. Using a tech -\\nnique developed by Isaac Newton, he computed orbits for 24 comets that \\nhad appeared between 1337 and 1698, and he contended that a single comet \\nactually accounted for three of those visits. It had appeared in 1531, 1607, and \\n1682. He also predicted its return in late 1758 or early 1759.7 Though Halley \\ndid not live to see his comet’s next reappearance, it did return. A German \\namateur made the first recorded observation on Christmas evening, 1758.8 \\nHalley’s Comet, as we now name it, settled the question about cometary lon -\\ngevity and rendered these objects relatively predictable members of the cos -\\nmos. If one could track a comet for the few days or weeks of an apparition, one \\ncould generate its orbital characteristics and predict its future motion.\\nHalley also had the foresight to wonder what would happen should a comet \\nstrike Earth. But he did not strongly pursue the question—perhaps wisely, for \\nthe sake of his reputation. The same century in which Halley’s comet predic -\\ntion was made and confirmed also witnessed the development of the doctrine \\nof uniformitarianism within the natural sciences. Uniformitarianism taught \\n(in various formulations) that “the present is the key to the past.” It was articu -\\nlated in 1795 by James Hutton and subsequently popularized (and purged \\nof its religious overtones) by John Playfair’s 1802 revival, Illustrations of the \\nHuttonian Theory of the Earth .9 Uniformitarianism proposed that the same \\nnatural laws and processes operating today have always operated throughout \\nEarth history, at the same rate and across the entire planet:\\n7.

In a prior statement, Hutton illus -\\ntrated the distasteful connotation attached to the catastrophist side, rejecting \\nappeals “to any destructive accident in nature, or to the agency of preternatu -\\nral cause, in explaining what actually appears.”11\\nFor both Hutton and Lyell, changes on Earth, like the gradual cycles of \\nerosion or uplift, occurred over an inconceivably vast time span, providing no \\nhope of deducing either a beginning or an end.12 Intended to remove natural \\nscience from theology—for example, the biblical flood would be catastrophic, \\nand thus unacceptable as an explanation under uniformitarian ideals—it also \\nled scientists to reject natural cataclysms as an explanation for Earth’s features. \\nExtraterrestrial impacts could not be shapers of Earth.

One such \\nexplanation involved the condensation—often in conjunction with a light -\\nning strike—of minerals within the atmosphere. This idea, bolstered by con -\\ntemporary enthusiasm for recently discovered electrical phenomena, retained \\nsupport well into the 19th century. By that time, however, chemical analyses \\nhad revealed that the majority of fallen and found stones are both remarkably \\nsimilar to each other in texture and composition and markedly distinct from \\nthe typical rocks of Earth. This observation pointed to a single, external origin \\nfor meteorites, and the Moon was an obvious candidate.

Chladni’s first report was followed over the \\nnext several years by an entirely coincidental spate of highly prominent falls, \\nculminating in the spectacular fall of thousands of stones at L’Aigle, France, \\nin 1803.

While conducting observations for what would become \\na famous star catalog, Italian astronomer Giuseppe Piazzi discovered a new \\nobject—Ceres—in an orbit that appeared more planet-like than comet-like. \\nCeres also fit what is known as the Titius-Bode law. Published in 1766, this \\nrule inferred from the spacing of the inner planets that there should be a planet \\nbetween Mars and Jupiter; and another beyond Saturn. The 1781 discovery of \\nUranus approximately where the Titius-Bode law had forecast seemed a con -\\nfirmation of its accuracy; Ceres, too, was in the right place. Piazzi first thought \\nit might be a comet, but other astronomers doubted that. After the 1802 dis -\\ncovery of Pallas, traveling in a similar orbit, William Herschel declared the \\ntwo objects to be a new class of celestial body: asteroids.16\\nThe asteroids occupying orbital space between Mars and Jupiter are known \\ncollectively today as “main-belt asteroids,” to mark a distinction between them \\nand the many other varieties of asteroid orbits discovered since. They are still \\nthe largest known asteroid population, and one, Ceres itself, was later reclas -\\nsified as a “dwarf planet” by vote of the International Astronomical Union in \\n2006.17 Main-belt asteroids’ orbits generally keep them far away from Earth, \\nand they are not classed as near-Earth objects. But their orbits can be per -\\nturbed, and over the eons some have been shifted into orbits that take them \\ninto the inner solar system.\\nThe first such near-Earth asteroid to be discovered was 433 Eros, found \\nin 1898 by German astronomer Gustav Witt.18 Since the discovery of Eros, \\nscientists (and many devoted amateur astronomers) have identified many \\nthousands of near-Earth asteroids.

The recognition that large impacts could influ -\\nence the evolution of life itself is an extension of what is known as the Alvarez \\nhypothesis, named for a famous 1980 paper by Luis and Walter Alvarez.19 \\nThis posits that an impact at the end of the Cretaceous period forced the \\ndinosaurs into extinction. Acceptance of the idea that large impacts have \\ntransformed both the surface of Earth and life itself represents a rejection of \\nstrict uniformitarianism, or what Stephen J.

Discovery of the enormous, buried \\ncrater left by the end-Cretaceous impactor in 1990 (or, as we will see in chap -\\nter\\xa04, reinterpretation of an already-known structure), was the second. The \\nspectacular collision of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 with Jupiter in July 1994, \\nwitnessed by ground observatories, by the Hubble Space Telescope, and by \\nthe Galileo spacecraft en route to Jupiter, was the third, and most dramatic, \\nevent. These led to Congress directing NASA to find at least 90 percent of the \\n1-kilometer-diameter or larger near-Earth asteroids within 10 years (see chap -\\nter 5). And NASA currently has a directive to discover and track 90 percent of \\nall the near-Earth asteroids larger than 140 meters—those about seven times \\nthe size of the Chelyabinsk impactor—which could cause regional damage on \\nEarth in the event of an impact.21\\n19.

Often called simply Bode’s law, it is \\ntoday thought of as little more than a curious mathematical relationship, but \\ntoward the end of the 18th century, it was taken seriously—especially when \\nthe 1781 discovery of Uranus at a distance of about 19 au seemed consistent \\nwith this pattern. If this relationship is assumed to be valid, the argument \\nwent, then there could well be an undiscovered planet in the gap between \\nMars and Jupiter at a heliocentric distance of 2.8 au.\\nBaron Franz Xaver von Zach, director of the Seeberg, or Gotha, Observatory \\nin Germany, organized a search for the missing planet. He intended to have \\neach of 24 astronomers agree to search a particular region of the zodia -\\ncal sky by comparing the observed stars to an accurate catalog of known \\nstars.2 Each observing zone would be 15 degrees in ecliptic longitude and \\n2. Baron von Zach planned to limit the search to the zodiacal regions of the sky, where \\nthe plane of ecliptic contains the paths of the Sun, Moon, and planets, and where a \\nnew planet would be most likely to reside.The Bode’s law relationship denotes the relative heliocentric distances of \\nthe planets as follows: \\nThe Sun-Saturn distance is taken as 100 units.\\nMercury’s distance is then 4 units.\\nVenus is 4+ 3 = 7 units.\\nEarth is 4 + 6 = 10 units.\\nMars is 4 + 12 = 16 units.\\nGap = 4 + 24 = 28 units.\\nJupiter = 4 + 48 = 52 units.\\nSaturn = 4 + 96 = 100 units.\\nUranus = 4 + 192 = 196 units.\\nThus, if Earth has a heliocentric distance of 1 astronomical unit (1 au),  \\nthen the first planet Mercury (n=0) is at a distance of 0.4 au and \\nsubsequent planetary distances are given by a = 0.3 n + 0.4, where a is the \\ndistance to the Sun (in au) and n = 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and so on, with \\nthe values of n doubling as planets are added.Box 1-1.

Of particular interest are the eccentricity \\n(e), which is zero (or one) for a circular (or parabolic) path about the Sun and the semi-\\nmajor axis (a), which is half the distance between the object’s closest distance to the \\nSun (perihelion, or q) and the object’s furthest distance from the Sun (aphelion or Q). \\nSo, q = a (1 – e) and Q = a (1 + e). Early orbit determination techniques were quite \\ndifficult, and oftentimes the task was made easier by assuming that the eccentricity \\nwas zero for a planet or asteroid while the eccentricity of a comet was often taken to be \\none.

However, he \\nencountered tremendous difficulties, even assuming a circular orbit. Orbit \\ndetermination techniques of the day normally assumed that the object’s orbital \\npath was either circular (eccentricity = 0) or parabolic (eccentricity = 1). It \\nwas not clear that the orbit of Ceres fell into either of these categories. What \\nwas needed was a general orbit determination technique that made no initial \\nassumptions about the object’s orbital eccentricity or heliocentric distance.\\nThe German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, only 24 years old at \\nthe time, seized upon this challenge and, within little more than a month, \\nhad developed the required orbit determination process. Using three of the \\n22 observations that Piazzi provided (1 January, 21 January, and 11\\xa0February \\n1801), Gauss initially computed the orbital parameters of Ceres. Subsequent \\nrefinements of his orbit determination process iteratively improved the match \\nbetween the observed and computed positions using a so-called “least squares \\ntechnique”—another of his inventions.8 Thus Gauss was able to adjust the \\ninitial orbital parameters to fit all of the valid observations. Gauss was widely \\nacknowledged as the greatest mathematician of his time, and his least squares \\ntechnique, as well as a modified version of his initial orbit determination pro -\\ncess, is still in use today.\\nIn September of 1801, von Zach published several forecasts of the prospec -\\ntive orbit, including his own and that of Gauss, which was markedly differ -\\nent from the others (and would turn out to be correct).

The \\nrelatively new idea that this particular crater might have been formed in an \\nimpact event had taken hold of Gilbert’s imagination a few months earlier at \\nthe 1891 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement \\nof Science (AAAS), where he heard the eminent mineralogist A.

The other relied on a magnetic survey of the region to look \\nfor a buried magnetized mass. It only took a few days to see that neither test \\nwas looking favorable for the impact hypothesis, and Gilbert ultimately con -\\ncluded, “It follows, under my postulates, that the great meteor is not in the \\nhole…chief attention should be given to other explanations of the crater.”28\\nIn retrospect, it might seem obvious that Gilbert’s two crucial tests would \\nfail, not because the impact hypothesis was wrong, but because his assump -\\ntions about the buried “star” were incorrect. Today, Meteor Crater is known to \\nhave been formed by an impact about 50,000 years ago, in which a 50-meter \\nnickel-iron body struck Earth while traveling at about 12 kilometers per \\nsecond, impacting, and mostly vaporizing altogether. Under these circum -\\nstances, there could be no iron mass to be found beneath the crater floor. The \\ndeveloping understanding of impact physics as an essentially explosive process \\nwould make this clear by the middle of the 20th century, but for Gilbert, the \\nevidence unequivocally ruled out the hypothesis he had originally favored, \\nand he had to abandon it.29\\nThis episode left such an impression on Gilbert that when he did eventually \\npublish his results several years later, it was in the context of a philosophical \\nargument. In his outgoing address as the president of the Geological Society of \\nAmerica in 1895, he related his theory of “The Origin of Hypotheses: Illustrated \\nby the Discussion of a Topographic Problem,” in which he presented the puzzle \\n27.

To begin with, he noted that the sizes of lunar craters vastly over -\\nshadow those of terrestrial volcanoes, and the enormous range of crater sizes is entirely unlike the distribution of Earth’s features. An even bigger problem, Gilbert argued, was the vast disparity in form. The most common type of ter -\\nrestrial volcano, the stratovolcano (e.g., Mount Vesuvius), with its tall sloping sides, relatively shallow caldera, and misshapen or altogether absent central cones, looks very different from the typical crater described at the beginning \\nof his paper. “Thus,” he concluded, “through the expression of every feature \\nthe lunar crater emphatically denies kinship with the ordinary volcanoes of the earth.”\\n37\\nTurning to the meteoric hypothesis, Gilbert cited Richard A. Proctor’s The \\nMoon  (1873) as the oldest developed theory he could find, also mentioning an \\n1882 article by A.

While this difficulty could be resolved by supposing that the \\nMoon’s bombardment had occurred in the distant past, it hinted at a scale of \\ncatastrophe beyond imagining and required the additional assumption that \\nany similar craters formed on Earth had been subsequently weathered away.\\nAnother difficulty concerned the material properties of the surface and \\ntheir behavior in a crater-forming collision, since lunar surface materials \\nmust somehow have been simultaneously plastic enough for huge cavities to \\nbe sculpted and rigid enough to support and retain the resulting landforms. \\nGilbert dismissed this issue by invoking the difference in scale between geo -\\nlogical processes and laboratory experiments, noting that “under sufficient \\nstrains great bodies of rock both bend and flow.”39\\nThe final two obstacles faced by meteoric theories concerned the expected \\nshapes and dimensions of the resulting craters. Gilbert argued that the vol -\\nume of each lunar crater cavity should (according to the same assumption he \\nmade at Meteor Crater) be less than that of its rim, part of the interior being \\ntaken up by the buried impactor—but this was not consistent with lunar \\nobservations. However, his projectile experiments showed that the rebound \\nresponse of the target material during impact could result in variations from \\nthis expected behavior, thus mitigating the third obstacle.40\\nFinally, common experience would lead one to expect varying crater \\nshapes, ranging from perfectly circular to elliptical. From geometric argu -\\nments, Gilbert derived a distribution of impact angles (assuming impac -\\ntors arriving uniformly from all directions) showing that the most common \\nimpact angle is 45 degrees, with significant numbers expected to strike at \\nshallower angles. The lunar craters, however, are manifestly too uniformly \\ncircular to have been produced by such a distribution of meteor strikes. To \\naddress this problem, Gilbert introduced his “moonlet theory” of crater for -\\nmation, which was suggested to him by the rings of Saturn. A similar ring, \\nhe posited, might have once orbited Earth, eventually coalescing to form our \\n39. Gilbert, The Moon’s Face , pp. 258–259. Interestingly, Gilbert recognized that the \\nenergy associated with the cosmic velocities of meteors would be large enough to \\nexpect melting. He took this argument no further, however, explaining later that only \\na small portion of the impactor’s kinetic energy would go to heating the impactor \\nitself; the rest would go toward heating the target material, forming the crater, and \\nmodifying the motions of the Moon.\\n40.

A natural consequence of this formation scenario would be the “scars \\nproduced by the collision of those minor aggregations, or moonlets, which \\nlast surrendered their individuality.”41 By first gathering the impacting bodies \\ninto a ring, Gilbert slowed them from a cosmic velocity to the escape velocity \\nof the Moon, about 1.5 miles per second (2.38 kilometers per second) and \\nallowed them to fall at much steeper impact angles. In this way, the distribu -\\ntion of expected ellipticities could be brought closer into alignment with his \\nanalysis of the shapes of craters measured on lunar photographs. Moreover, \\nGilbert asserted, many disparate observations could be explained by his the -\\nory, including the white streaks emanating from some craters and the fine \\n“sculpture lines” radiating from Mare Imbrium, which he interpreted as the \\nproduct of “the violent dispersion in all directions of a deluge of material—\\nsolid, pasty, and liquid.”42\\nToward the end of his exposition, in a section titled “Retrospect,” Gilbert \\nreflected on his own thought process in formulating his moonlet theory, \\ninvoking the same method of multiple working hypotheses that he would \\nlater emphasize in his 1895 presidential address to the Geological Society of \\nAmerica. Initially confronted with two hypotheses, and seeing how neatly \\nthe impact theory could explain lunar crater characteristics (in contrast to \\nthe volcanic theory, which could not), he was gradually converted “from \\nthe attitude of a judge to the attitude of an advocate.”43 Gilbert also noted \\nthat meteoric theories may have suffered from an unfair bias, since the plas -\\nticity of rocks subjected to extreme pressures lies far outside the realm of \\ncommon\\xa0experience.\\n“The Moon’s Face: A Study of the Origin of Its Features”  was published in \\nthe Bulletin of the Philosophical Society of Washington  (where Gilbert’s address \\nhad been given), reprinted in Scientific American Supplement , and circulated \\nwidely in abstract form.

Optical engineer \\nand photography expert Herbert E. Ives, recruited to the U.S. Signal Corps in 1918 to help improve aerial photographic techniques, was struck by the \\nvisual similarity of bomb craters viewed from above and the cratered surface \\nof the Moon. In 1919, he published his impact theory for lunar craters based on the crucial idea that the impactor’s kinetic energy, abruptly converted into \\nheat, would result in an explosion very much like the T.N.T. bombs developed \\nin the war. The resulting crater would not be elliptical whatever the impact angle because “the shape of the cavity has no reference to the angle at which \\nthe bomb strikes, but takes its form from the symmetrical explosive forces.”\\n15\\nIn France, Meudon Observatory astronomer Jean Bosler published a simi -\\nlar energy conversion argument in 1916, calculating in one example that an impactor might carry two million times more energy than a German \\n“marmite” shell. Like Ives, Bosler included photographs of shell and bomb \\nimpression on a young Estonian astronomer named Ernst J. Öpik, who published a \\nbrief article in 1916 referencing his impact-as-explosion theory and working out some of its consequences. This paper, later widely cited as the earliest expression of this \\ntype of impact theory, was published in Russian in an obscure journal and therefore \\nreceived little attention. In fact, the key points attributed to Öpik were actually formulated by Morozov. In any case, neither work influenced the development of the explosion analogy, and this case provides a clear illustration of both the language barrier that existed between researchers working on opposite sides of the globe and \\nthe fact that the same problem is sometimes solved multiple times throughout history. \\nAlso see E.

One line of reasoning \\nthat appeared over and over in both the WWI-related explosion papers and \\nresponses to them was the presence or absence of a terrestrial analog.

By this time, largely through the efforts of Barringer \\nhimself, the crater had come to be accepted by many eminent astronomers and geologists as the remnant of a collision with an extraterrestrial body—a \\nnear-Earth object. Reports of another potential impact structure at Odessa, \\nTexas, had already surfaced in 1922 and 1926, and others were soon to fol -\\nlow.\\n22 At long last, the impact hypothesis had a terrestrial analog, and at least \\none near-Earth object was accepted as having left its mark on Earth.\\nThe Tunguska Impact Event\\nShortly after 7:00 a.m. on 30 June 1908 (00:14 UT), a powerful explosion occurred over the basin of the Podkamennaya Tunguska River in central \\nSiberia. Although contemporary accounts differ somewhat, the event was \\ndescribed as an atmospheric fireball as bright as the Sun. From eyewitness accounts, the bolide likely had an entry angle of about 30 degrees with respect \\nto the horizon and an arrival azimuth angle of about 110 degrees east of north. \\nThe terminal height of the explosion was estimated to be 5–12 kilometers, and the shock wave was accompanied by a strong blast of highly heated air.\\n23 \\nAlthough not immediately correlated with the Tunguska event, seismic and \\npressure waves as well as geomagnetic disturbances were recorded in several \\nwidespread observatories, and bright nights, or prolongations of twilight, were reported throughout Eurasia.\\nFor more than a decade, no notice of the Tunguska event was taken beyond \\nlocal newspapers. It was 1922 before Russian geologist Leonid A. Kulik \\noutcome, Moulton wrote: “When we get in the domain of astronomical masses of \\nhundreds of thousands of tons, we are like a child who, after playing a few times with his rattle, suddenly sees and seeks to grasp the moon. If it is explained to him that \\nit is something of quite a different order from the things of his experience, he casts \\nthe statements aside as purely theoretical and, relying on his practical experience, reaches again, proves (to himself) the correctness of his views by the assertion that he has always held them and that all other children hold them” (p. 126).

Born in Tartu, Estonia, in 1883, Kulik had spent 1911–12 in a czarist \\nprison for revolutionary activities and would later die of typhus in a World \\nWar II Nazi prison camp in April 1942. In early 1918, after the 1917 October \\nRevolution, Kulik went to the Soviet Academy of Sciences in Petrograd (now \\nSaint Petersburg) and began his work on meteorites. In 1921, he was assigned \\na two-year expedition to gather information on a giant meteor event witnessed \\nin Siberia in June 1908. Working out of a railcar designed for the purpose, \\nKulik visited many locations in Siberia seeking information on the location \\nof the expected meteorite. However, he soon determined that the most likely \\nlocation of the event was in the Tunguska area, a region so remote that he \\nwas unable to reach the area during this first expedition. He then persuaded \\nthe Soviet government to fund another expedition to the Tunguska region, \\nbased on the prospect of finding meteoric iron that could be mined to aid \\nSoviet\\xa0industry.\\nIn 1927, after an arduous two-month journey, Kulik succeeded in visit -\\ning the Tunguska blast site and was struck by immense destruction that far \\nexceeded his expectations.25 A widespread area of the forest had been uprooted \\nand flattened. As a result of this research expedition to the Tunguska blast site \\nand his subsequent returns in 1928, 1929–30, and 1938–39, Kulik attributed \\na number of boggy depressions to meteorite impacts and made an effort to \\nexcavate these depressions to recover the meteorites. Despite these excavations, \\nas well as geodetic and magnetic surveys of the area, Kulik found no meteor -\\nites either on the ground or at the bottom of the depressions.26 However, the \\non-site investigations and those that followed revealed a curious pattern: the \\nimpact blast region outlined a butterfly-shaped pattern of some 80 million \\nfelled trees—a great number of them burnt—over an area estimated at 2,150 \\nsquare kilometers.\\n24.

The relatively low \\naltitude of the explosion (about 10 kilometers) would favor an asteroidal ori -\\ngin, though, as asteroids are less friable.

Unnoticed by Western \\nscientists for a couple of decades, it represented an explosive event that did not \\nleave an impact crater.29 Later generations of scientists would use it to help \\n27.

These strands of inquiry \\nincluded the geological investigation of terrestrial impact and cryptovolca -\\nnic features, the impact origin of lunar craters, the mechanics of cratering \\nas a physical process, and the identification of unique signatures associated \\nwith\\xa0impact.\\nWhile many geologists and astronomers had been convinced by 1929 of \\nMeteor Crater’s cosmic origin, the same could not yet be said for lunar craters, as illustrated by the limited success of the Carnegie Committee for the Study of the Surface Features of the Moon. Founded in the mid-1920s and directed \\nby petrologist Frederick E. Wright, the interdisciplinary committee was com -\\nposed of astronomers, physicists, and geologists and was aimed at definitively \\nsettling the question of the origin of lunar craters. While most members of \\nthe committee supported the volcanic theory, Wright eschewed the use of \\nterrestrial analogs, focusing instead of determining the nature of lunar mate -\\nrials.\\n31 Unfortunately, Wright’s approach, which focused on polarization \\nlake bottom, and evidence has been raised both for and against this hypothesis.

Th ere are still arguments over the magnitude of the Tunguska event. A recent NASA \\nworkshop organized by David Morrison of NASA Ames Research Center found an \\nexplosive energy of 10–20 megatons of TNT, roughly the same as the Barringer event that formed Meteor Crater.

The number of known asteroids had blossomed from 131 in 1878 \\nto 250 in 1885, and in the 1930s, Mount Wilson Observatory astronomer \\nWalter Baade estimated that about 44,000 would be detectable by the 100-\\ninch reflector. At Yale University and the University of California, Berkeley, in \\nparticular, interdisciplinary work on orbital mechanics, including resonances, \\nas well as classification into asteroid families, brought physical, mathemati -\\ncal, and astrophysical methods into play. In his 1938 dissertation, Fletcher \\nGuard Watson, Jr., presented the first estimate of the collision frequency for \\nEarth-crossing asteroids: one in every hundred thousand years.33 In the mean -\\ntime, another interdisciplinary project got under way at Harvard University \\nunder the direction of Harlow Shapley. Convinced, along with the majority \\nof astronomers, that meteors were primarily of interstellar origin, Shapley put \\ntogether the Harvard Arizona Meteor Expedition to home in on the average \\nvelocity of meteors. The expedition itself, directed by Ernst Öpik and Fred \\nL. Whipple, ran from 1930 to 1932 and used visual methods to track meteor \\nvelocities. Öpik found a majority above 42 kilometers per second, indicat -\\ning hyperbolic (extrasolar) orbits, but this conclusion was later challenged by \\nWhipple’s synchronized photographic survey (1934–36), indicating that the \\noverwhelming majority of meteors were indeed solar system objects.34\\nStarting with the Odessa crater in Texas, the number of suspected terres -\\ntrial impact structures also skyrocketed over the course of a few short years. \\nI.\\xa0A.

By 1963, using aer -\\nial photographic surveys to identify the most promising targets and following \\nup with gravity, seismic, magnetic, and drill core studies, the program quickly \\nidentified three new Canadian craters that neatly fell on Baldwin’s depth-to-\\ndiameter trend. One of these, 13-kilometer-diameter Deep Bay Crater, closed \\na gap in the size range of known craters, underscoring Baldwin’s suggestion \\nthat impact cratering is a fundamental geologic process.43\\nIn the United States, another institutional shift was occurring, largely \\nthanks to a new impetus: the race to the Moon. Joint U.S. and Soviet partici -\\npation in the International Geophysical Year (1957–58) precipitated Sputnik’s \\nlaunch and the founding of NASA, and the announcement of the lunar pro -\\ngram in 1961 established spaceflight as a major government-funded objective. \\nYet the notion that American ambitions to land on our satellite would be \\nintimately tied to geological—and more specifically, impact-related—investi -\\ngations was far from a foregone conclusion.

The subject of the parody, Eugene M. “Gene” \\nShoemaker, was not present to witness the spoof, but he was all too familiar \\nwith the kind of resistance to lunar and impact studies it represented within \\nthe geological community. Shoemaker first became interested in studying \\nlunar craters and understanding the geology of the Moon in the early 1950s. \\nWhile working for the USGS during a break from his Ph.D. thesis in 1953, he \\njoined the Atomic Energy Commission’s Megaton Ice-Contained Explosion \\n(MICE) project, which explored the possibility of creating plutonium by \\n43.

This project led him to study \\nboth shock wave theory and diatreme volcanism as a means of understanding \\nthe ejecta distribution left by underground explosions.44\\nTo that end, he also set his sights on Meteor Crater in Arizona. His first \\nglimpse of the crater had been brief and hurried, but “an overwhelming sight” \\nnonetheless, as Carolyn Shoemaker recalled. On an impulsive side trip on \\nthe way to Grand Junction, the Shoemakers found that they could not afford the admission fee to see the crater, and they drove down an access road to \\npeer over the rim just as the Sun was setting. After examining a sample of \\npumiceous silica glass two years later, Shoemaker noted that the temperature required to fuse the quartz far exceeded any achieved by a volcanic agent, \\nand when Project MICE presented the opportunity to study the crater more \\nthoroughly, he eagerly set about mapping its structure.\\n45\\nContinuing his study of underground explosions, Shoemaker followed \\nup his survey of Meteor Crater with a visit to the nuclear bomb test craters \\nJangle\\xa0 U and Teapot Ess. His comprehensive comparison of the structure \\nof these artificial craters to that of the larger Meteor Crater—including the inverted stratigraphy (“overturned flap”) noted by Barringer and Tilghman \\nhalf a century earlier—convinced him that the one was an “eerily close scaled-\\nup” version of the other. These observations led Shoemaker to develop his own theory of cratering mechanics, which forms the foundation of modern \\nimpact\\xa0physics.\\n46\\nIn parallel with these structural revelations, Shoemaker and others were \\nestablishing a new mineralogic marker for impact processes. Coesite, a high-pressure phase of silica, had been discovered in 1953 and later found in sam -\\nples from Meteor Crater by Edward Chao.

But of course, there would \\nbe many more smaller objects as well. Success came slowly, and it took six \\nmonths before they discovered a highly inclined Apollo asteroid (5496) 1973 \\nNA on 4 July 1973. Helin commented, “There was a lot of sweat and tears \\nfor each observing run.”2 The first female observer permitted to use Mount \\nPalomar’s facilities regularly, she was initially able to acquire only seven pairs \\nof films per night. On the evening of 7 January 1976, Helin discovered 2062 \\nAten, the first member and namesake for the orbital class of near-Earth objects \\nwhose orbital periods are less than one year, meaning that they orbit, on aver -\\nage, inside Earth’s orbit. The PCAS efforts during the first five years netted \\nonly about 1–3 per year. But during the period from 1973 through the late \\n1980s, the PCAS survey was responsible for discovering a large percentage of \\nall near-Earth asteroids. \\nThe PCAS survey imaged 8 to 10 fields of sky twice per night, once with a \\n20-minute exposure and once with a 10-minute exposure using Kodak IIa-D \\nfilm with a yellow filter. The PCAS threshold magnitude for the detection of \\nfast-moving objects was initially about 15.5 but improved to about 17.5 in the \\n1990s. Each 6.5-inch circular film covered an 8.75-degree circular field of \\nview. Upon development of the films, the 20-minute exposures were scanned \\nmanually with a binocular microscope for the trailed images that would \\nindicate a relatively fast-moving object on the fixed star background. Any \\ntrailed images found would then be compared with the 10-minute exposure \\nfor verification. After a trial period of a few years, the PCAS team moved to a \\nmore efficient method of detecting NEO images on their films in 1981. Using \\nfaster emulsion films, two shorter exposures of approximately 6 minutes were \\nrecorded a half hour apart, so any near-Earth asteroid would no longer have \\nobvious trailed images, but these two images would be offset from one another \\non the two films because of the asteroid’s motion between the two exposures. \\nThere would be no offsets for the images of the background stars and gal -\\naxies that did not move from one film to the next. When the films were \\nviewed through a stereomicroscope, a near-Earth asteroid appeared as one \\nimage “floating” above or below the background, depending upon the object’s \\ndirection of motion. Initially, all films exposed in one night were examined \\n2.

In 1977, \\nhe had proposed a dedicated “Spacewatch Telescope,” similar to the 1.2-meter \\nSchmidt he had used on Palomar, but larger and dedicated exclusively to the \\nhunt for near-Earth objects.14 That proposal went nowhere. In early 1980, \\nhe tried again, teaming up with Gene Shoemaker, Robert McMillan, and \\nseveral other colleagues, this time proposing a dedicated 1.8-meter CCD-\\nbased Spacewatch camera and data-processing system that would be installed \\nin an existing dome on Kitt Peak, operated by the University of Arizona’s \\nSteward Observatories. This proposal was not funded either; at a June 1980 \\nmeeting with William E. Brunk and Geoffrey Briggs, the astronomy pro -\\ngram officials at NASA Headquarters, he was told that NASA did not see the \\nconstruction of ground telescopes as part of its mission, and that they were \\nconcerned about “the possibility of unforeseen technical problems that would \\ncause delays and cost overruns.” The “agonizing delays and overruns” of the \\nnew Infrared Telescope Facility, built on Maunakea and completed in 1979, \\nwere fresh on their minds.15\\nBut Brunk and Briggs supported the scientific goals of the proposal, which \\nincluded finding Earth-approaching asteroids that could be visited by future \\nSpace Shuttle–based missions and improving understanding of what Gehrels \\nhad called the “hazard aspect” of near-Earth objects. NEOs were a hazard due \\nto the “low but finite” probability of a catastrophic impact, but the actual risk \\ncould not be quantified adequately. “The problem would no longer be statisti -\\ncal in nature if all the Earth-crossing asteroids down to about 150 meters in \\ndiameter were detected and their orbits accurately determined. Any collision \\nthat might occur in the near term (next few decades) could be forecast ,” Gehrels \\nhad contended.16 So Brunk was willing to fund a design study for the facil -\\nity—in NASA’s jargon, this was to be a Phase A study.\\n14.

The 1980 election put Ronald \\nReagan into the White House, and his administration levied significant cuts \\nacross most federal agencies, including NASA. So while the phase A study \\nresulted in a completed conceptual design for the facility, what NASA ulti -\\nmately funded was just the CCD-based camera and its data-processing system. \\nThe camera was designed to be mounted on an existing 0.9-meter Newtonian \\ntelescope at Kitt Peak. The Newtonian design had two light paths for two \\ninstruments, and Gehrels had to share the telescope with a radial velocity \\ninstrument intended to search for planets around other stars developed by \\nKrzysztof Serkowski, later taken over by Robert S. McMillan when Serkowski \\npassed away in 1981. This arrangement was less problematic than it might \\nseem, as the radial velocity experiment needed bright stars and could observe \\nduring the part of the month astronomers call “bright time,” the two weeks \\nsurrounding the full Moon, while the Spacewatch camera needed the “dark \\ntime” surrounding the new Moon to hunt for much dimmer asteroids.17\\nThe first Spacewatch camera was designed and built by Jack Frecker, who \\nhad also designed Gehrels’s balloon-based precursor to his polarimeters on \\nPioneers 10 and 11, the Polariscope. It used an RCA 320- by 512-pixel CCD \\nas its detector with a coffee can loaded with dry ice to keep the detector cold. \\nIt was built quickly, seeing “first light” in May 1983. In his newsletter, The \\nSpacewatch Report , Gehrels reported that the camera’s first targets were parts \\nof the sky with known asteroids, as a means of demonstrating that the com -\\nplex new system actually worked. “The asteroids were promptly found in the \\ncomputer processing of the data; it was probably the first time in history that \\nan asteroid was found with a CCD system.”18\\nJames V. “Jim” Scotti, hired as an undergraduate to write the data-\\nprocessing software, later described how the system worked. Initially, the idea \\nhad been to have the telescope quickly image the target areas of the sky and do \\nthis several times each night.

Readout was done by a Data General Nova \\ncomputer, with the data written to tape. Each scan could be up to 29 minutes \\nlong, and they imaged the same part of the sky three times in an observing \\nnight—twice in quick succession and a third time later in the night.

Astronomers deployed various \\nother tools to try to understand these qualities.\\nIt was a full century after the discovery of the first asteroid, Ceres, that \\nthe Austrian astronomer, Egon von Oppolzer, noted periodic variations in \\nan asteroid’s brightness. Taking advantage of the Earth approach by Eros in \\nlate 1900 (to within 0.32 au), Oppolzer observed it at the German Potsdam \\nObservatory and was surprised to find that the asteroid faded by a factor \\nof 4 (an increase of 1.5 magnitudes) in 79 minutes and then returned to its \\noriginal brightness over the next few hours, only to wane yet again.30 The \\nentire brightness period took 5 hours and 16 minutes, a value in agreement \\nwith more modern rotation period determinations. It was recognized that this \\nwas an effect due to the rotation of Eros and one of the following possibili -\\nties: the body had light and dark sides; two co-orbiting bodies were eclipsing \\none another; or the body of Eros was irregularly shaped, so that its apparent \\nbrightness depended upon which of its sides was being viewed.\\nBy observing an object’s apparent brightness over long intervals of time, \\none can determine the object’s rotation period from a plot of the asteroid’s \\nbrightness as a function of time.

The basic technique, \\nbouncing radio waves off various objects, had been used as early as the 1920s \\nfor ionospheric research. It became famous during World War II for its mil -\\nitary utility, and it was again used for scientific research at the war’s end. \\nIn September 1945, the U.S. Army Signal Corps’ Evans laboratory in New \\nJersey started trying to bounce radio waves off the Moon, though they were \\nnot successful in detecting the returned signals until January 1946. Similar \\nexperiments were conducted almost immediately in Britain and Hungary; \\nwar surplus radars were also quickly turned to the study of meteors.44\\nOne of the fundamental weaknesses of radar as a tool for solar system \\nresearch is that the returned signal strength declines with the inverse fourth \\npower of the distance. So detecting returned signals from celestial objects \\nrequires powerful transmitters, extremely sensitive receivers, and large anten -\\nnas. The MIT Lincoln Lab’s Millstone Hill radar, built as a prototype ballistic \\nmissile early warning radar, was used in 1958 to try to receive echoes from \\nVenus but was probably not successful. (They attempted to verify apparently \\npositive results with a second set of experiments in 1959 but were unsuccess -\\nful.) In March 1961, using a “bistatic radar” consisting of separate transmit -\\nting and receiving antennas built originally for communications purposes, \\nJPL’s Goldstone Deep Space Information Facility near Barstow, California, \\nwas unequivocally successful.45\\nobservations using the Keck 10-meter telescope on Maunakea, Hawai’i, confirmed a \\n12-kilometer satellite of Hektor. Hektor is the only asteroid at the L4 position (leading \\nJupiter) named after a Trojan hero. The remaining members at L4 all have Greek \\nnames. At the L5 position (trailing Jupiter), which is reserved for asteroids with Trojan \\nnames, asteroid (617) Patroclus is the sole exception.

Alvarez and geologist Walter Alvarez, it posited that a \\nroughly 10-kilometer asteroid had impacted somewhere on Earth about 65 \\nmillion years ago, at the boundary between the Cretaceous and Paleogene \\nperiods of Earth’s history.1 The enormous amount of pulverized rock and \\ndust thrown into the atmosphere would have produced a years-long darkness, \\nexplaining the mass extinction already known to have occurred.2 Their argu -\\nment was based on discovery of a thin clay layer enriched in iridium, a metal \\nthat is rare on Earth’s surface but common in meteorites. While many other \\nscientists had proposed that large impacts could produce mass extinctions, \\n1. The Paleogene period (66 mega annum [Ma] to 23 Ma) was formerly part of the Tertiary \\nperiod (66 Ma to 2.5 Ma), and the extinction event referred to as the Cretaceous–\\nTertiary extinction, often shorthanded as “K–T.” The International Commission on \\nStratigraphy abandoned the Tertiary nomenclature in 2008, and the current term for \\nthe timing of the extinction event is “K–Pg.”\\n2.

Some scientists embarked on a search for the crater; while a few large \\ncraters were known by 1980, none were of the correct age. Over the next \\n15\\xa0 years, most scientists involved with the search for the impactor’s crater \\ncame to accept that a roughly 200-kilometer circular magnetic and gravita -\\ntional anomaly under the Yucatán Peninsula that had been discovered in the \\n1950s was, in fact, the crater remnant.\\nOther scientists sought mechanisms for the extinction. Not everyone \\nbelieved that the dust-induced climatic cooling that the Alvarez team had \\nhypothesized was adequate to explain the mass extinction apparent in the \\nfossil record. Indeed, many paleontologists were initially skeptical that the \\nimpact could be responsible for the mass extinction at all. In their view, the \\ndisappearance of the non-avian dinosaurs was gradual, not sudden, and thus \\nthe impact could not be the principal cause.\\nBy the early 1990s, though, most researchers involved in the controversy \\nhad also accepted a set of mechanisms that together could explain the end-\\nCretaceous mass extinction.

The Caspian Sea and other large lakes in \\nthe world could have been created by cometary impacts, and finally, in a very \\nprescient comment, Halley noted that widespread extinction of life, before the \\n3.

Asteroids, though, can bring iridium to Earth’s surface, and at a rela -\\ntively constant rate. Thus, measuring the amount of iridium in the clay layer \\nwould provide a proxy measurement of the layer’s deposition period. At least, \\nthat is what the Alvarez team thought initially.\\nThey had samples of the layer tested by Frank Asaro, but the result did \\nnot answer their question at all. If it were true that iridium came from space \\nat a fixed rate, then the amount of iridium in this thin layer of clay was far \\ntoo high—20 times as high as it should have been, given the expected rate \\nof inflow. To clarify the situation, they went looking for another site with \\ncontinuous deposition across the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (not many \\nwere known at the time) and found one in Denmark. It also showed a highly \\nelevated level of iridium.10 There were not many possible causes of such a huge \\nspike in iridium.\\nOne possible cause for such an elevated level had been proposed back in \\n1971: a nearby supernova. Such an event would have been devastating to life \\non Earth and would have deposited lots of iridium. But a supernova would \\nhave left other smoking guns as well, notably plutonium-244 (Pu-244). With \\nan 80-million-year half-life, any plutonium-244 that was present when Earth \\nformed more than 4 billion years ago has long since decayed to undetectable \\nlevels. So any Pu-244 detected around the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary \\ncould only be the product of a nearby stellar detonation—conclusive evidence. \\nBut no such signature was found in the mysterious clay layer, ruling out the \\nsupernova hypothesis.11 That left a giant meteor strike as the likely source of \\nthe iridium enrichment they had discovered.\\nWalter attributed to his father the realization that the atmospheric effects \\nof an impact might provide a mechanism for extinction. A large impactor \\nwould literally blow away part of the atmosphere and flood the rest with enor -\\nmous amounts of rock vapor and dust. Based on their iridium measurements \\nand impact frequency estimates, they calculated that such an impactor would \\nlikely have been around 10 kilometers in diameter or larger. Some fraction \\nof that large amount of material would remain in the stratosphere for years. \\n“This dust,” they wrote in their 1980 paper, “effectively prevented sunlight \\nfrom reaching the surface for a period of several years, until the dust settled to \\n10.

Loss of sunlight suppressed photosynthesis, and as a result, most food \\nchains collapsed and the extinctions resulted.”12 The Alvarez team did not \\npostulate a crater location, though they did comment that since the impactor \\nhad a two-thirds chance of impacting an ocean, there was a good chance that \\nthe resulting crater had already been subducted and had thus been erased.\\nThe Alvarezes found the iridium component of their work rapidly corrobo -\\nrated by others. Walter presented first results at a September 1979 meeting in \\nCopenhagen and met Jan Smit, who had already found a similar anomaly at \\nan outcrop in Spain. (He had not yet published it because he had been ill.) But \\nothers followed, too. By the time their paper was published, elevated iridium \\nhad been found in a Cretaceous–Paleogene–age outcrop in New Zealand \\nas\\xa0well.13\\nThree main points of controversy followed their 1980 publication. One \\nis familiar already: the time-honored argument that volcanoes were really \\nresponsible—either for the iridium layer or for the extinction—whenever \\nimpact is invoked. The Deccan Traps volcanism, which spanned the same \\nperiod but was much longer in duration, formed the touchstone of this argu -\\nment.14 The second point involved extinction mechanisms: the impactor \\nwould not just have thrown enormous amounts of dust into the atmosphere. \\nScientists conceived, and sought evidence for, other killing mechanisms initi -\\nated by such an impact. The third point of controversy was simply the location \\nof the crater, which many scientists wanted to find.\\nAmong those who immediately dove into analysis of the Alvarez claim \\nwas James Pollack’s research group at NASA Ames Research Center. A spe -\\ncialist in planetary atmospheres, Pollack had focused on understanding the \\natmospheres of Mars and Venus in the 1970s, assembling a group of atmo -\\nspheric modelers with diverse interests and developing models for studying \\natmospheric chemistry, as well as radiative transfer.

Toon took the opportunity to comment on another \\npotential mechanism that had been suggested by Emiliani, Kraus, and \\nShoemaker: that heat, not cold, had been the killer. An asteroid impact in \\nthe ocean (they hypothesized a North Pacific impact site) would have injected \\nenormous amounts of water vapor into the atmosphere. Since water vapor is \\na greenhouse gas, it might have led to a rapid, but short, warming event that \\ncaused the extinction.19 Toon pointed out that the dust and aerosols, which \\nwould be produced by an impactor this size regardless of impact site, would \\ninitially prevent much sunlight from reaching the surface, so there would be \\nno immediate warming. But there might be a warming pulse after the dust \\nhad settled. This pulse was hard to quantify because some of the water vapor \\nwould have been removed with the dust.20\\nAt the Snowbird meeting, John O’Keefe and Thomas Ahrens of the \\nCalifornia Institute of Technology (Caltech) Seismological Laboratory \\nexamined the impact from the standpoint of energy. An impactor of the size \\nexpected by the Alvarez team would not be slowed by atmospheric entry (nor \\nwould it be by seawater), and thus the energy it supplied to the atmosphere \\nand/or ocean would come from the shock waves and ejecta produced by its \\nimpact on the solid surface of Earth. The impact would produce a “jet” of \\nsuperheated material—molten and vaporized rock as well as dust—that would \\nreach space. A small portion of this material would reach escape velocity and \\nleave Earth entirely; the rest would reenter, with the smallest particulate sizes \\nremaining in the stratosphere and above for weeks and possibly months. The \\nejecta blanket would be global (the Alvarez clay layer was the global expres -\\nsion of the finest ejecta sizes) and roughly sorted so that the closer one got to \\nthe impact site, the thicker the blanket would be.\\nO’Keefe and Ahrens also addressed the question of heat. Their calculations \\nsuggested that a little more than a third of the impact energy would be trans -\\nferred to the atmosphere by the ejecta via several different mechanisms, while \\n19.

They had not, of course, but that would soon change.23 In the \\nearly 1980s, the Defense Department was planning to shift nuclear policy \\naway from primarily targeting cities (which could be destroyed most effec -\\ntively with air bursts) toward targeting Soviet missile installations, for which \\nground bursts would likely be more effective. That would throw a lot of dust \\ninto the air, just as volcanoes and asteroid impacts would, making the Pollack \\ngroup’s work very relevant to nuclear policy. They eventually received a formal \\nletter from the Defense Nuclear Agency asking them to study the atmospheric \\neffects of nuclear warfare.24\\nInitially, Ackerman did not think that nuclear weapons would have a \\nmajor effect on the climate. A detonation would loft orders of magnitude less \\nmaterial into the atmosphere than the Cretaceous–Paleogene asteroid, and it \\nwould not produce a great deal of sulfate aerosol, either. So nuclear war did \\nnot seem capable of causing a climate catastrophe. But one of his collabora -\\ntors, Richard Turco, who worked at a private research company, send him a \\ndraft of a paper in March 1982 that completely changed that interpretation.25 \\n21. John D.

Titled \\n“The Atmosphere After Nuclear War: Twilight at Noon,” the paper drew an \\nanalogy between large forest fires and nuclear war. Burning forests produce \\nsoot in addition to dust, and soot is black—it is carbon, after all. Black soot \\nabsorbs sunlight, heating itself and the air around it. That heated air, in turn, \\nhelps keep the soot aloft, creating a feedback loop ensuring that soot does not \\nfall back out of the atmosphere as quickly as dust.\\nWorse, forests would not be the only thing to catch fire under nuclear \\nattack. Cities are full of petrochemicals and their derivatives, plastics, which \\nalso burn and produce soot. And their calculations suggested that the petro -\\nchemical contribution of soot would be several times that of the forest fires. \\nCrutzen and Birks concluded that\\nthe average sunlight penetration to the ground will be reduced by a factor \\nbetween 2 and 150 at noontime in the summer.

Wendy Wolbach, then of the University of Chicago, \\nled a team that studied the clay layer deposited in the handful of Cretaceous–\\nPaleogene layers that had been sampled in the early 1980s, but not originally \\nfrom a post-impact climate standpoint.

They contended that the amount represented \\nabout 10 percent of the total biomass carbon on Earth (in 1985), meaning that \\n“the scale of the putative wildfires must have been enormous.” In addition to \\nthe climate impact of the soot, the fires would have produced pyrotoxins that \\n“would harm most land life. Carbon monoxide alone, if produced in the same \\namount as soot, would reach 50 ppm in the atmosphere, a distinctly toxic \\nlevel.”29 These fires would have occurred even if the impactor had struck an \\nocean site and not land, because the enormous, expanding cloud of vaporized \\nrock would reach continents from any impact site and ignite vegetation.

If the \\nimpactor had crashed into one of the ocean basins, the resulting crater might \\nalready have been subducted into the mantle over the ensuing 66 million \\nyears. If it had fallen into Antarctica, it would be buried in ice. And if it had \\nstruck continental shelf, it might be buried in sediments.

Since the \\nejecta would be scattered the world over, the composition of that target rock \\nwould provide an important clue as to the location of the crater.

The yellow glasses derived from sulfur-rich sedi -\\nments, which are relatively rare on Earth’s surface—but not on the Yucatán \\nPeninsula, which consisted of continental crust with a few kilometers of alter -\\nnating carbonate and anhydrite (anhydrous calcium sulfate) layers on top of \\nit. In other words, the chemistries were similar enough to link the glasses to \\nthe Yucatán impact site.\\nBut the main point of the paper focused on the implications of this min -\\neralogical association.

That resulted in \\nother scientists asking Raup and Sepkoski for preprints of the paper, so by \\nthe time it was actually published, Nature  had received a number of papers \\nproposing cosmic mechanisms.58 The journal chose to publish them in a sin -\\ngle issue: 19\\xa0April 1984. Gene Shoemaker had pointed out to Raup in 1983 \\nthat passage of the solar system through the “arms” of our galaxy might dis -\\nturb the Oort cloud at the far edge of our solar system enough to unleash a \\ncomet bombardment on the inner solar system, but that would occur on a \\n100-million-year time scale, not a 10-million-year one.59 \\nOne of the Nature  papers published in April 1984 advanced the hypothesis \\nthat an “unseen companion to the Sun, travelling in a moderately eccentric \\norbit,” periodically passes through the Oort cloud, triggering the release of a \\nbillion comets into the inner solar system on the 26-million-year cycle. A few \\nof these, they proposed, had hit Earth over the ensuing million years. The \\nSun’s mysterious companion might have remained hidden, being small, dim, \\nand relatively slow-moving against the background of more distant stars. They \\nalso understood some professional risk in hypothesizing an invisible star: “We \\nworry that if the companion is not found, this paper will be our nemesis.”60 \\nTheir proposal is sometimes known as the “Nemesis hypothesis”—or the \\n“Siva hypothesis,” after Stephen J. Gould argued in favor of the Hindu god of \\ndestruction instead.61\\nIn January 1985, still another possible extraterrestrial agent for periodic \\nbombardment was identified—“Planet X.” Daniel Whitmire and John \\nMatese of the University of Southwestern Louisiana proposed the existence of \\na 10th planet as the solution to a basic problem of orbital mechanics: that well-\\nknown discrepancies in the orbits of the outer planets required the presence of \\nsome other large body between 1 and 5 times the mass of Earth as an expla -\\nnation.

The pockmarked face of the Moon provided clear evi -\\ndence that early in the solar system’s existence, much larger collisions than \\nChicxulub’s must have happened. Mars displays such evidence, too. Analyses \\nof the Chicxulub impact suggested that the thermal radiation produced by the \\nejecta would subject Earth to around 10 kilowatts of power on every square \\nmeter of its surface (with variations from place to place), igniting fires as well \\nas causing “widespread mortality and desiccation of plant life,” which would \\nthen itself be vulnerable to ignition by lightning.64 Larger impacts would cre -\\nate even larger heat pulses at the surface. At some point, the ocean surface \\nwould boil, producing a global steam bath that would serve as an effective \\nsterilizing agent (and, of course, cook the dwellers of the ocean shallows). \\nWhat was that level? How big would an impactor have to be to completely \\nboil away the oceans?\\nIn 1989, a team led by Norman Sleep of Stanford University raised these \\nquestions in the context of establishing when the last impact large enough \\nto sterilize the early Earth could have happened. To researchers interested \\nin the evolution of life, that was a key question. Knowing the answer would \\neffectively bound life’s timeline. They found that an impactor about the size \\nof main-belt asteroids Vesta and Pallas, around 440 kilometers in diameter, \\nwould be sufficient to completely boil away Earth’s oceans. The world would \\nbe enveloped by rock vapor and molten rock that would take several months \\nto condense out.

The caliber of the nuclear bomb \\nrequired to fragment a solid rock the size of the asteroid (about 1,000 mega -\\ntons) was out of reach, and it was too late to launch a mission to reach it at \\naphelion—the slowest point in its orbit and hence the best opportunity to \\nefficiently change its velocity. They would have to reach Icarus on its inward \\ntrajectory as it barreled toward Earth. At that point, the asteroid would be \\ntraveling too fast for a gentle rendezvous, so a spacecraft would need to be \\nlaunched quickly, intercept Icarus, and detonate its payload on arrival.\\nIn the end, the students found that a single such explosion would not be \\nsufficient, and they settled on a multi-stage mission concept. In the spring \\nof 1967, six Saturn V rockets were in production, and the first test was not \\nscheduled until November. The Icarus Project plan called for all six rockets \\n(plus three more for test flights, requiring an increase in the speed of produc -\\ntion) to be modified to carry a Payload Module containing a 100-megaton \\nnuclear bomb. The payload would itself have been a challenge to produce, \\ngiven that the largest nuclear weapon then in American hands topped out at \\n25 megatons. These would be detonated sequentially, gradually nudging the \\nasteroid out of Earth’s path. The first launch would need to take place by April \\n1968, with the others following every two weeks. Additional probes called \\nIntercept Monitoring Satellites would be launched ahead of and alongside \\nthe primary mission to observe the process, since next to nothing was known \\nabout the true effects of detonating a nuclear weapon in space near the surface \\nof an asteroid, and the 1963 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty effectively banned any \\nexperimentation to find out.\\nProject Icarus was only a fictional exercise, and 1566 Icarus’s close pass \\non 14 June 1968 came and went without incident. Nevertheless, the project \\nand resulting reports of the students’ plan left a legacy that would influence \\nsubsequent deflection studies, not least because they directly inspired the \\nmovie Meteor!  that debuted in 1979, bringing public attention to the pos -\\nsibility of Earth impact and potential defense strategies.

Little was known in 1967 about the physical characteristics of 1566 \\nIcarus, and that problem was general to all near-Earth objects that might be \\nconsidered targets of deflection attempts. By the late 1970s, studies consider -\\ning collisions in the asteroid belt and the presence of collisional families of \\nobjects spawned the term “rubble pile” to describe a structure composed of \\ndisrupted fragments held together rather loosely by gravity. Future asteroid \\ndeflection and mitigation studies would have to wrestle with the additional \\nproblem that a rubble-pile asteroid might simply split into pieces after a miti -\\ngation attempt, converting a single, massive impact into a shotgun blast of \\nsmaller, but not much less destructive, impacts.\\nPerhaps the first effort by asteroid scientists to gain policy salience for \\nimpacts was a 1981 study chaired by Gene Shoemaker. It was the result of a \\nNASA Advisory Council effort to help define NASA’s future programs. These \\noutside consultants and technologists proposed several future research themes \\nand one subpanel, which included Barney Oliver (vice president of Hewlett-\\nPackard), suggested investigating the potential hazard of Earth-colliding \\ncomets and asteroids.4\\nParticipants in this four-day workshop at Snowmass, near Aspen, \\nColorado, included Barney Oliver, Tom Gehrels, George Wetherill, Clark \\nChapman, General Theodore Taylor, astrodynamicist Alan Friedlander, geo -\\nscientist David Roddy, and NASA program chief for planetary astronomy \\nWilliam Brunk.5 Perhaps because of Gene Shoemaker’s busy schedule, the \\nresulting Snowmass report, consisting of about 100 draft pages, was never \\npublished, though a typescript was widely distributed.6 Normally, an unpub -\\nlished report would have little influence on the field, but some of the ideas \\nand concepts in this report would be carried forward in a 1989 popular book, \\n3.

The international conference was held \\nin San Juan Capistrano, California, in July 1991 and was chaired by Clark \\nChapman. Three search program workshops, held in 1991, were chaired by \\nNASA Ames Research Center’s David Morrison, and the Near-Earth Object \\nInterception Workshop was held at Los Alamos, New Mexico, the next year \\nand was chaired by John Rather from NASA’s Office of Aeronautics and \\nSpace\\xa0Technology.\\nThe report summarizing Morrison’s search program workshops, known \\nas the 1992 Spaceguard Survey report, defined the spectrum of NEO threats \\nand discussed the most efficient means for “dramatically increasing the detec -\\ntion rate of Earth crossing objects.”23 The Workshop participants were inter -\\nnational in scope, and their report was the first to note that discovering the \\nlargest objects should take priority. Based upon the research of NASA Ames \\nResearch Center’s O. Brian Toon, it was noted that an impact by an NEO \\nlarger than about 1 kilometer in diameter, while rare, would have global con -\\nsequences.24 This group recommended a goal of finding 90\\xa0percent of Earth-\\ncrossing asteroids larger than 1 kilometer in diameter and proposed a global \\nnetwork of six search telescopes, each 2.5 meters in aperture, to accomplish \\nthis task. The effort would cost about $50 million in capital expenditures and \\nbe expected to reduce the risk of an unforeseen cosmic impact by more than \\n75\\xa0percent over the course of 25 years, with annual operations costs of about \\n$10 million. The proposed survey would be expected to discover fully 90\\xa0per -\\ncent of the NEOs larger than 1 kilometer in diameter.25\\nNothing much happened immediately after the Spaceguard workshops. \\nFundamentally, neither NASA nor the Air Force was interested in the task of \\nfinding near-Earth objects.

It was tasked \\nwith defining “systems and technologies to alter the orbits of such asteroids \\nor to destroy them if they should pose a danger to life on Earth.”27 The meet -\\ning was chaired by John Rather, with Jurgen Rahe as cochair and Gregory \\nCanavan of LANL as official host. The 94 participants arrived from varied \\nbackgrounds, including academic NEO scientists as well as several weapons \\nspecialists from U.S. national laboratories that included LANL, Lawrence \\nLivermore National Laboratory (LLNL), Sandia National Laboratory, and the \\nStrategic Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO), which had been set up in \\n1984 by the U.S. Department of Defense to develop a United States defense \\nsystem against incoming nuclear missiles. NEO scientists and weapons physi -\\ncists, coming from such different cultures, were likely to interact in a conten -\\ntious fashion—and they did.\\nThe SDIO had developed a concept called Brilliant Pebbles, whereby \\nnonexplosive U.S. defensive missiles about the size of watermelons would be \\ndeployed to ram incoming offensive missiles, destroying them. Lowell Wood \\n(LLNL), a protégé of Edward Teller (LLNL), had circulated a paper noting \\nthat small, few-meter-sized asteroids (“the stuff between a truck and a house \\nin scale”) represented a significant threat and that Brilliant Pebble–type inter -\\nceptors could be counted upon to knock them off course, or destroy them, \\nbefore they had a chance to impact Earth’s atmosphere. Perhaps to explore \\nthe tradespace without a size limit imposed, Wood’s analysis failed to prop -\\nerly consider the mitigating effect of Earth’s atmosphere on these small aster -\\noids; most would not reach Earth’s surface anyway. To counter large impact \\nthreats, some of the weapons physicists were eager to test nuclear deflection \\ntechniques in space, and others suggested that missiles be placed at the ready \\non Earth’s surface or in Earth orbit to fend off any incoming asteroids that \\nmight prove a threat. Teller, who had been the architect of the U.S. hydrogen \\nbomb program, noted that a new super-bomb might have to be developed to \\n26. Tagliaferri interview.\\n27.

In the first case, detonation of a radiatively effi -\\ncient nuclear explosive near the object (a “stand-off explosion”) would spray \\nthe surface with high-energy neutrons, irradiating an outer shell on one side \\nof the asteroid. This layer—which Ahrens and Harris estimated to be about \\n20\\xa0 centimeters in depth—would then be removed as material is imparted \\nwith velocity in excess of the escape velocity. This blow-off would in turn \\nimpart an impulse to the remainder of the asteroid in the opposite direction, \\nslightly changing its course. With a lead time of about a decade, the deflection \\nvelocity required to divert an asteroid was found to be about 1 centimeter per \\nsecond. To achieve this value for a 100-meter impactor, this approach would \\ncall for the detonation of an approximately 0.01- to 0.1-kiloton nuclear explo -\\nsive. For an asteroid 10 times larger, this energy would increase by 1,000 to \\napproximately 0.01 to 0.1 megatons. Likewise, a 10-kilometer object would \\nrequire an approximately 10- to 100-megaton explosion. This method had \\ntwo advantages: first, it depended somewhat less on detailed knowledge of the \\nphysical characteristics of the asteroid; and second, “the development of the \\nnuclear weapons required to deflect large Earth-crossing objects seems to be \\nfeasible technologically.”31\\n28. At one point in the discussions on the use of nuclear devices to deflect or destroy \\nthreatening asteroids, Lowell Wood shouted out, “We’re all here, we’re after the same \\nthing. Nukes forever,” which many attending NEO scientists found rather chilling. \\nMorrison interview, 17 May 2016.\\n29. 5006 Teller, discovered by Helin at Palomar Observatory on 5 April 1989.

Material ejected by the explo -\\nsion, itself too dispersed to pose a threat to Earth, would induce a velocity \\nchange in the object. According to calculations by Ahrens and Harris, this \\nmethod could be as efficient in deflecting an asteroid as the nuclear ablation \\nmethod, but it comes with a major drawback: the asteroid might be inadver -\\ntently disrupted, producing large fragments that could themselves threaten \\nEarth. This was more likely in the case of a “rubble pile” asteroid, so one \\nneeded decent knowledge of the asteroid’s composition before execution.\\nThe third strategy, fragmentation via a buried explosive charge, also carried \\nthe threat of producing large and dangerous pieces of the original asteroid. To \\nmitigate this risk, the object would need to be disrupted one or more orbits \\nprior to its arrival at Earth to allow the debris to spread out along and trans -\\nverse to its orbit. In situ drilling would also be required to optimally bury \\nthe nuclear charges, presenting another difficulty, particularly in low-gravity \\nenvironments. Thus, fragmentation was not considered to be a particularly \\nsafe choice except perhaps in the case of a small body or a very long lead time \\nof decades. In the opposite situation (a large impactor discovered on close \\napproach), fragmentation was assessed to be unavoidable.32\\nAhrens and Harris considered two non-nuclear approaches as well: the \\nkinetic impactor and the mass driver. In the former strategy, the impact of a \\nspacecraft-borne mass could directly transfer enough kinetic energy to deflect \\na small asteroid, on the order of 100 meters in size. For larger sizes approach -\\ning 1 kilometer, however, they found that the thousandfold increase in aster -\\noid mass, together with the decrease in cratering efficiency due to the body’s \\nstronger gravitation, would make direct-impact deflection impractical. In the \\nmass driver scenario, a spacecraft would be sent to the asteroid to excavate \\nand electromagnetically accelerate material from a particular area, ejecting it \\nfrom the body. The mass driver would likely have to operate for many years to \\nachieve the required deflection velocity. While the study authors deemed such \\na system technically possible, they nevertheless felt that “nuclear energy offers \\na much more efficient solution.”33 Both the kinetic impactor and mass driver \\ntechniques, as well as several other novel ideas, would continue to be studied \\nin the decades to come, but the Interception Workshop’s assessment of current \\n32.

At a meeting hosted by Tom Gehrels at the University of Arizona in \\nTucson in January 1993, the AIAA’s Tagliaferri recalled a long conversation \\nhe had with Carl Sagan, a vocal opponent of developing deflection technolo -\\ngies. Sagan was convinced that the ability to divert an asteroid from its course \\nwould inevitably fall into the wrong hands and be turned to ill purposes.37 \\nTagliaferri understood the concern but felt the impact hazard warranted the \\nrisk because the argument against nuclear deflection could not hold up against \\ncalculations like those of Ahrens and Harris. “The numbers don’t lie. If you’re \\ngoing to move these things, you’re going to need that kind of energy density, \\nand nothing else will do that.”38\\nMany of the NEO scientists at the meeting found these suggestions both \\nunnecessary and dangerous, and some felt that the weapons scientists were \\n34.

On 15 October 1992, shortly before \\nthe Erice meeting, a significant amount of media attention erupted around an \\nannouncement of a possible Earth collision of Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle on \\n14\\xa0August 2126.46 Swift-Tuttle had been discovered in 1862 and then lost; \\nit was recovered by U.S. Naval Observatory astronomers on 30\\xa0September \\n1992 and reported to the Minor Planet Center.47 Brian Marsden, Director \\nof the Minor Planet Center, then had difficulties in reconciling the 1862 and \\n1992 observations, which suggested to him that the comet might be sub -\\njected to significant accelerations from the comet’s outgassing (i.e., rocket-like \\ncometary thrusting or so-called nongravitational effects). Furthermore, these \\naccelerations might allow Marsden’s estimate for the comet’s next predicted \\nperihelion passage time (11 July 2126) to be early by 15 days—enough time \\nto allow a subsequent Earth collision on 14 August 2126. By calculating the \\nratio of the time the comet would sweep past Earth to the uncertainty in the \\ncomet’s perihelion passage time, Marsden computed an impact probability of \\nabout one in ten thousand, and this was widely reported by David Chandler \\nin the Boston Globe  and by William Broad in the New York Times .48\\nUpon receiving Marsden’s announcement of a possible 2126 Earth impact, \\nYeomans at JPL was able to fit the 1992 and 1862 data, as well as the time of \\na 1737 perihelion passage recovered from Chinese texts, to within 24 hours, \\nwithout the so-called nongravitational parameters that are often used to rep -\\nresent the motions of active comets.

One of the first indications that the impacts would be far from a fizzle \\narrived when observers at Calar Alto Observatory in southern Spain reported \\nthat a small dot had appeared on the limb of Jupiter where the fragment A \\nimpact point was predicted to be.62 The dot brightened quickly, becoming \\nas bright as the innermost satellite Io before fading again. When the impact \\npoint rotated into view of ground-based astronomers again, a small but per -\\nsistent dark spot appeared at visible wavelengths. It was immediately clear \\nthat the coming impacts would put on a show—and fragment A was one of \\nthe smaller fragments! After the largest fragment (G) hit, Vikki Meadows, \\nwho had observed in Australia, recalled that they had to partly mask the \\nmirror of the Anglo-Australian telescope, effectively shrinking its aperture \\nfrom 3.9\\xa0meters to only 1.9 meters, because the brightness had saturated their \\ninfrared\\xa0detector.63\\nEach impact event had three stages:64\\n1.

Even so, the tidal force that had fragmented \\nthe comet was so weak that one impact specialist likened the comet’s strength \\nto less than that of a fluffy soufflé.

The time of capture into \\nJupiter orbit is likewise uncertain due to the chaotic nature of the comet’s \\nmotion.

In their report dated June 1995, the \\nNear-Earth Objects Survey Working Group recommended a program that \\nwould be expected to discover 60–70 percent of short-period NEOs larger \\nthan 1 kilometer in 10 years (by the end of 2006, for funding beginning \\nin FY\\xa01996). They recommended the construction of two dedicated 2-meter \\naperture telescopes and one or two 1-meter telescopes with advanced focal \\nplane detectors. Also recommended was access to larger-aperture telescopes \\non demand for the physical characterization of near-Earth objects. These \\nassets would then be expected to extend the survey’s completeness to 90 per -\\ncent over the following five years (by 2011), but anticipated cooperation from \\nthe U.S. Air Force and international programs could shift the attainment of \\nthe 90 percent goal forward to 2006.70\\nThe estimated five-year development cost to NASA would be $24 million \\n(in FY 1995 dollars) with annual operations costs of $3.5 million. The Near-\\nEarth Objects Survey Working Group Report was delivered to Congress in \\nAugust 1995, but due to NASA’s budgetary pressures, the cover letter provided \\nby NASA recommended against an initiation of the recommended program. \\nNot surprisingly, the funding wasn’t appropriated.71 This would not be the \\nlast time that NASA management would be reluctant to accept the mantle of \\nplanetary defense against asteroid impacts.

In the early \\n1990s, while assigned to the Air Force Phillips Laboratory in Albuquerque, \\nNew Mexico, he interacted with Tom Gehrels, who was anxious to gain access \\nto the CCD detector development that the Air Force was supporting at MIT’s \\nLincoln Laboratory in Lexington, Massachusetts. These CCD detectors were \\nbeing developed to improve the Air Force’s capability to observe and track \\nEarth-orbiting spacecraft using ground-based optical telescopes—an activity \\ncalled space surveillance. Gehrels, who actively solicited funds and new tech -\\nnology from a number of sources, wished to utilize modern CCD detectors for \\nhis Spacewatch near-Earth asteroid survey program. At the Lincoln Lab, the \\nperson in charge of the state-of-the-art, extremely fast-readout CCD detec -\\ntors was Grant Stokes, who would later become the Principal Investigator for \\nthe extremely successful, NASA-supported Lincoln Laboratory Near-Earth \\nAsteroid Research (LINEAR) program that operated (1996–2013, 2015–17) \\nnear Socorro, New Mexico. LINEAR was the first survey to utilize sensitive \\nand rapid-readout CCD detectors for near-Earth asteroid discoveries.72 Prior \\nto the use of CCD detectors for space surveillance, the Air Force had used \\nslower and less-sensitive analog video detectors in their so-called Ground-\\nbased Electro-Optical Deep-Space Surveillance (GEODSS) systems that were \\noperational near Socorro; on Haleakalā, Maui, Hawai’i; and on Diego Garcia \\nin the Indian Ocean.73\\nWith the end of the Cold War, support for Air Force space surveillance \\nassets had dwindled, and Lindley Johnson thought that if the Air Force Space \\nCommand were to adopt asteroid planetary defense as a mission, then the \\nsupport for space surveillance might rebound. He saw planetary defense as \\nan extension of ongoing space surveillance Air Force activities rather than a \\ncompletely new mission. The Air Force’s GEODSS routinely captured near-\\nEarth asteroids in its imagery, but GEODSS operators simply ignored them \\n72. For the discovery of near-Earth asteroids, the survey that can search the most sky in \\na given time will dominate other surveys with comparable telescope apertures.

He noted that the asteroid’s descend -\\ning nodal crossing was outside Earth’s orbit in 2028 but that planetary per -\\nturbations would cause the nodal distance to decrease in subsequent years \\nand, in fact, cross Earth’s orbit around 2037.89 Furthermore, the Earth close \\napproach in 2028 could change the orbital period of the asteroid from 1.73 \\nyears to anything between 1.58 and 1.99 years, depending on the conditions \\nof the encounter. For every rational number between these limits, there is a \\ncorresponding trajectory that would bring the asteroid back for another close \\napproach to Earth in a later year. For example, if the asteroid were to pass \\nabout 210,000 kilometers from Earth in 2028, its period would change to \\n1.80 = 9/5 years, which would bring it back to Earth in 2028 + 9 = 2037, \\nduring which time the asteroid would have completed five orbits. In a math -\\nematical exercise, Marsden provided an example orbit, consistent with the \\nearlier 88-day set of observations, which he claimed would actually result in \\nan impact in 2037.\\nThe day after Marsden’s claim, Chodas performed a preliminary analysis \\nof the 2037 close approach using an orbital error analysis involving a Monte \\nCarlo technique.90 His conclusions disagreed with Marsden’s. He found that \\nan impact in 2037 was essentially impossible but that an extremely close \\napproach of only 0.5 Earth radius above the surface was possible. In a 10\\xa0June \\ne-mail to colleagues summarizing the results, Chodas noted that “about 40 \\ncases out of 20,000 passed through a keyhole in the 2028 error ellipse to \\narrive within 1.5 million km of Earth in 2037.” The descriptive term “key -\\nhole,” coined by Chodas, refers to a particularly small region of space near \\nEarth. If the approaching object happens to pass through this small region, \\nEarth’s gravity can perturb it onto a trajectory that returns for a later close \\napproach. The 2028 keyhole passage leading to the 2037 Earth encounter \\ndid not seem to allow an impact in that year, but what about other keyhole \\npassages that would lead to Earth close approaches in other years? Marsden \\nlater identified another impacting scenario based on the short 88-day arc, \\nthis one having a post-2028 period of 12/7 = 1.71 years and leading to Earth \\n89. That is, 1997 XF11 would pass, north to south, through Earth’s orbital plane and at \\nEarth’s actual heliocentric distance.\\n90.

Although the MPC did even -\\ntually provide the observations after a specific request was made following the \\nannouncement, it was clear that NEO observations had to be routinely distrib -\\nuted to the scientific community in a more timely fashion.

Between 1973 and 1978, they had identified five Earth-\\ncrossing and seven Mars-crossing asteroids. Of the Earth-crossers, three were \\n“Aten”-class asteroids whose orbits lay primarily sunward of Earth’s, while \\ntwo were “Apollo”-class asteroids. (See appendix\\xa02.) Other surveys had found \\nfour more Aten and Apollo-class asteroids, bringing the known total to nine. \\nAccounting for the limiting magnitude of their 46-centimeter Schmidt tele -\\nscope and using several different statistical methods to extrapolate from this \\ntiny number of asteroids, they arrived at an estimate of 800 ± 300 near-Earth \\nasteroids of these classes. This projection fell within the same order of mag -\\nnitude as an earlier estimate of Shoemaker’s, which had been based on the \\nnumbers and ages of large impact craters.2\\n2. E. F. Helin and E.

The size of the asteroids could not be directly determined because the \\ntelescope only received reflected light; any given asteroid’s albedo affects the \\namount of light it reflects, so an asteroid of a given brightness could be large \\nand dark or small and bright. As a practical matter, therefore, size estimates \\ndepended upon albedo estimates.3 In their 1979 paper, Helin and Shoemaker \\navoided discussion of asteroid size altogether, instead focusing on the likely \\npopulations of various classes of asteroids as defined by their orbits.4\\nFor his unpublished 1981 report, Shoemaker compiled data for the 57 \\nknown near-Earth asteroids, of which 8 also had albedo estimates.5 He also \\nidentified eight asteroids that would likely now be referred to as “potentially \\nhazardous,” with their orbits passing within 0.02 au of Earth’s orbit. But he \\ndidn’t revisit the issue of asteroid populations in the report.

Edward “Ted” Bowell of the Lowell \\nObservatory in Flagstaff, Arizona, and a colleague, Karri Muinonen of the \\nHelsinki Observatory, developed a simulation for that purpose. They con -\\nstructed a model asteroid population of 320,000 objects using a set of power \\nlaws derived from the small number of known Earth-crossing asteroids and \\nfrom cratering rates, and they explored various approaches to discovering the \\nlargest number in the shortest time. Key issues were the choice of limiting \\nmagnitude (which affected telescope design), how much of the sky needed \\nto be scanned during each lunation, how often a part of the sky should be \\nrescanned, and how many observations would have to be processed each day \\nto achieve a real-time survey. Since new discoveries had to be reobserved \\nshortly after being detected in order to provide sufficient information for orbit \\ndetermination, a useful survey had to have near-real-time data-processing \\ncapability to ensure that asteroids would not be “lost” due to lack of follow-\\nup observations.\\nThis desire for a real-time survey ruled out the kinds of photographic \\nsurveys that the Shoemakers, Helin, and some others had been performing \\nfor decades. Bowell and Muinonen wrote, “[T]here is no feasible way, either \\nby visual inspection or digitization of the films, to identify and measure the \\nimages in step with the search.

In reality, this was impossible to achieve in a single \\nlunation because the Moon brightens the sky too much to find faint asteroids \\nand comets over part of the month, but simulating it nevertheless proved a \\nuseful exercise to help them understand all of the constraints on a real survey. \\nAt the limiting magnitude of the Palomar 46-centimeter Schmidt that the \\nShoemakers and Helin had been using, even a 25-year-long whole-sky survey \\nwould not find even half of the Earth-crossing asteroids larger than 1 kilome -\\nter in diameter. At a limiting magnitude of 20, slightly worse than that of the \\nSpacewatch 0.9-meter telescope, a 25-year survey would find around 70\\xa0per -\\ncent of the 1-kilometer or larger objects. Higher limiting magnitudes were \\nclearly beneficial; at 22nd magnitude, a survey system could reach 90\\xa0percent \\ncompletion in five years.8 This high yield occurs because the more light a \\ntelescope can collect, the farther away it can see any given asteroid. In other \\nwords, fainter performance meant peering farther into space, increasing the \\nvolume of space being scanned.\\nThe Spacewatch telescope itself would not be able to achieve these results, \\nhowever, as the drift scan technique severely limited the amount of sky it could \\naccess during the dark time of each month. That technique, of course, had \\nbeen developed to overcome the slow readout of the telescope’s detector. The \\nsimulations Bowell and Muinonen performed showed that a survey system \\nmore efficient than the Spacewatch 0.9-meter telescope would be needed to \\nscan the entire dark sky monthly to discover all of the 1-kilometer-class Earth-\\ncrossing asteroids within 25 years. Such a survey still would not discover all \\nthe Earth-crossing comets because long-period comets (by definition, with \\norbit periods greater than 200 years) would not necessarily be visible from \\nEarth during such a “short” survey period. The long-period comets would \\nrequire surveillance in perpetuity. But comets aside, it was now possible to \\nassess the risk from asteroids in a reasonable period of time.\\n7.

He still intended to build a larger, dedicated 1.8-meter telescope on \\nKitt Peak in Arizona. He even had a mirror for it—at least, he had the prom -\\nise of one. During the 1960s, the U.S. Air Force had built several lightweight \\nmirrors for a project known as the Manned Orbiting Laboratory, which was \\nintended to be, in essence, a crewed surveillance satellite.11 But the program \\nwas canceled in 1969.

But the Multi-Mirror Telescope was more successful. It \\nwas funded and built on Mount Hopkins outside Tucson. During its con -\\nstruction, though, one of its six mirror blanks was damaged, and Gehrels \\nloaned the project his mirror until the other could be repaired to help keep \\nthe project on schedule. The MMT was finished in 1979, and his mir -\\nror was removed and put in storage—where it would remain until January \\n1993. Getting the mirror returned was a considerable struggle, beginning \\nin 1990. As Gehrels’s loan had never been properly documented, without \\nproper paperwork, he kept running into bureaucratic barriers. He resorted to \\ngetting testimonials from Aden Meinel and others to convince the Steward \\nObservatories of the University of Arizona (which operated the MMT) and \\nthe Smithsonian Institution (which owned the telescope) to transfer the mir -\\nror to Spacewatch—which was itself, of course, also a unit of the University of \\nArizona. The deal that was finally struck between the MMT and Spacewatch \\nlate in 1991 was that Gehrels would get one of the mirrors (ultimately, he \\nacquired MMT-5) once full funding for his telescope was in hand.14 In fur -\\nther irony, by the time the transfer took place, the MMT was being converted \\nto a single large mirror configuration (a 6.5-meter mirror for it was cast in \\n1992), and all of its original mirrors would soon be removed and boxed, too.\\nThe successful operation of the 0.9-meter Spacewatch telescope and \\nthe growing interest in the near-Earth object threat enabled Gehrels to \\nraise the funds he needed to finally build the larger telescope.

Further improvements in 1997 \\nand 1998 reduced their “cycle time,” the time delay between one 20-second \\nexposure and the next, from 160 seconds to 45 seconds, increasing their \\nnightly sky coverage. NEAT’s allocation of observing time on Haleakalā was \\nreduced while they were upgrading the system; by 1998, they were down to \\nsix nights per month prior to the new Moon. The reason was simply that Air \\nForce Space Command, which owned the telescopes, had growing needs for \\nthem, and asteroids were not part of its mission. In 1998, the Air Force Space \\nCommand decided to upgrade the GEODSS data infrastructure in ways that \\nrendered the NEAT system incompatible. Ultimately, NEAT moved back to \\nthe 1.2-meter AMOS telescope, which came under the Air Force Research \\nLaboratory’s jurisdiction. The AMOS telescope needed upgrades too (that the \\nAir Force paid for) to accept the NEAT system,26 and NEAT stopped observ -\\ning between 1999 and 2000 to accommodate this work.\\nNEAT also gained an opportunity to use the 1.2-meter Oschin Schmidt \\nat Palomar Observatory in California. That telescope had a much wider field \\nof view, and the team designed a new camera for it that would cover part of \\nits focal plane with three 4k by 4k CCDs. The new design (called the “three-\\nbanger” for the three CCDs) also had better cooling and faster readout speeds. \\nThey built two of these, one for Palomar and one for the AMOS telescope. \\nThe team also renovated the Oschin Schmidt telescope for the same kind \\nof robotic control that was used in Hawai’i. For all of these reasons, NEAT \\nwas not generating new discoveries in 1999.27 They began observing again \\non the Maui Space Surveillance telescope during the spring of 2000, though \\nthat year witnessed very poor observing weather in Hawai’i that undermined \\ntheir productivity. They also experienced technical problems related to the \\nhumidity of the site. As a result, they were increasingly seen as unproductive \\ncompared to the other surveys.28 The NEAT project’s upgrades to the Oschin \\ntelescope on Palomar were completed late in 2000, and observations with its \\nthree-banger camera began in spring 2001.\\n26.

Grant Stokes of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory in \\nLexington, Massachusetts, had proposed using Lincoln-developed fast-readout \\nCCD cameras on the GEODSS telescopes at the Laboratory’s Experimental \\nTest Site (ETS) at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico for an asteroid \\nsurvey. Unlike the operational GEODSS telescopes that NEAT shared with \\nother Air Force efforts in Maui, the ETS telescopes were for research; the \\nLincoln Labs used them to try out new sensor technologies. The large-format, \\nfast-transfer CCD cameras that Stokes intended to use had been specifically \\ndeveloped as a potential upgrade for the operational GEODSS telescopes, so \\ncompatibility with the telescopes was never an issue. A prototype of the new \\ncamera and processing system was tested in August 1995 and July 1996 at \\nETS, just a few months before NEAT began observing on Haleakalā. The \\nJuly 1996 test series netted LINEAR its first NEO, 1996 MQ.29\\nThe success of the test series garnered Air Force funding to develop the com -\\nplete LINEAR system. In mid-1997, a nearly complete system with a smaller \\nCCD underwent further trials at ETS; the large-format CCD was installed \\nthat summer, and in October of 1997, a 10-night observing campaign gener -\\nated 52,542 observations and netted 9 confirmed new NEOs. Over the course \\nof 1998, LINEAR became the dominant discoverer of near-Earth asteroids, \\nand in 1999, it expanded further by equipping another of the ETS telescopes. \\nIt was so prolific that it overwhelmed the ability of follow-up observers to keep \\nup with its new discoveries and had to reprogram some of its observing time \\nto follow up its own discoveries, reducing its sky coverage to an extent.30 But \\nit remained the dominant survey through 2005. After 1998, though, Stokes \\nhad to begin drawing NASA funds from the NEO Observations Program to \\nmaintain operations.

One of these surveys was initiated at the Lowell Observatory \\nby Ted Bowell. The Lowell Observatory NEO Survey (LONEOS) was devel -\\noped around a 0.6-meter telescope and a wide-field camera. The Lowell \\nObservatory had been involved in doing astrometric analysis of the films \\ntaken by the Shoemakers at Palomar and had built an automated film ana -\\nlyzer for that purpose. Bowell had also developed his own public database for \\nnear-Earth asteroids during the mid-1990s, so the group, including observer \\nBrian Skiff and software engineer Bruce Koehn, had some expertise to build \\non. LONEOS was active over the 1993–2008 period, but technical problems \\ngetting the camera and telescope together hampered early efforts, and the \\ngroup did not start discovering NEOs until 1998. Between 1998 and 2008, \\nthe LONEOS team discovered a total of 290 NEOs, including the “lost” \\nasteroid 69230 Hermes and the second Atira asteroid to be found, 2004 JG6. \\nUltimately, though, their modest aperture did not make them competitive \\nwith other operational surveys, and, after a period when they provided pho -\\ntometry of NEOs, they ceased operations in 2008.\\nFinally, a second survey wound up being established at the Lunar and \\nPlanetary Laboratory of the University of Arizona (just three floors above \\nSpacewatch). Scotti, who had been hired to write Spacewatch’s software, \\ndecided to learn how to find asteroids and comets the old-fashioned way, on \\nfilm. There was an essentially unused 0.4-meter Schmidt on Mount Bigelow \\nstill configured for film, so he bought some film and recruited an undergradu -\\nate student, Timothy Spahr, to help him. Scotti wanted to try observing in \\nthe early-morning twilight near the Sun (where Spacewatch itself would never \\nlook) in hopes of finding a comet. Scotti participated for only a few months, \\nbut Spahr became an enthusiastic convert to asteroid and comet hunting and \\nfound a University of Arizona mentor in Steve Larson.31\\nLarson commented many years later that when he was preparing for \\nComet Hale-Bopp’s appearance in 1997, the company that made the 2k by \\n2k CCDs used by the NEAT project was having a sale, and he acquired one \\n31.

Larson e-mailed the \\nUppsala Observatory director at the time, discovered that he was actually vis -\\niting Tucson, and had a quick meeting to work out a memorandum of under -\\nstanding. Once the extensive modifications necessary to host a CCD camera \\non the Uppsala Schmidt were completed, Robert McNaught became the lead \\nobserver, and, together with his coworker Gordon Garradd, they provided the \\nonly NEO observations from the Southern Hemisphere.

These were accom -\\nplished on budgets that did not exceed $4 million per year, not counting the \\nAir Force contributions of technology and time (to LINEAR and NEAT), or \\nthat of amateurs in carrying out follow-up observations for new detections. \\nEuropean scientists’ efforts to stimulate interest were not nearly so success -\\nful. In 2000, the British National Space Centre commissioned a study of \\nwhat the United Kingdom could provide to an international NEO discovery \\nand characterization program.35 It gained little immediate traction. European \\nefforts to address the issue would not begin to crystallize until 2008, when the \\nEuropean Space Agency initiated a “Space Situational Awareness Programme” \\nto develop a European space surveillance capability covering space weather, \\nsatellites and debris, and near-Earth objects.\\nIn 2000, the NEAT team published a new estimate of the number of near-\\nEarth objects larger than 1 kilometer based on their discovery statistics to \\ndate. Between March 1996 and August 1998, they had discovered 26 near-\\nEarth asteroids larger than 1 kilometer, out of a total of 45 discoveries. They \\nthen generated a series of simulations of fictitious asteroid populations and \\nevaluated what NEAT would have detected out of those artificial populations, \\ngiven its known performance—amount of sky searched per month, limiting \\nmagnitude, and so forth. Comparing the simulation results to their actual \\nresults gave them an estimate of the likely completeness of their survey to date \\nand thus the total number of large near-Earth objects. They contended that \\nthere were about 700 such objects (±200), not greatly different from the esti -\\nmate developed by Shoemaker and Helin from their film survey in the 1970s. \\nThey also argued that the existing surveys would probably reach the goal of \\n90\\xa0percent discovery within 20 years, but probably not by the goal year of \\n2008. “Doubling the current world-wide detection rate would therefore lead \\nto near completion in the next decade,” they wrote.36\\n35.

Its operating costs \\nwere primarily funded by NASA and by fees paid by subscribers to the Minor \\nPlanet Circular . Private donations provided its computing infrastructure. It \\nwas a very small operation, with only two or three people to run the place.\\nBrian Marsden had been its director since the center had moved from the \\nCincinnati Observatory to the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in \\n1978. The MPC’s charge was to be the community repository for the astro -\\nmetric observations and orbits of comets and asteroids, and it also specified \\nthe rules for naming these bodies and for granting credit for new discoveries. \\nAstronomers, professional or amateur, submitted observations to the center \\ndaily, and for objects that were seen on more than one night, the MPC gen -\\nerated orbits from the observation data. During the MPC’s decades at the \\nCincinnati Observatory, Paul Herget had deployed punch-card–based calcu -\\nlating machines and later computers to calculate orbits.37 His equipment, tech -\\nniques, and banks of punch cards—Brian Marsden claimed almost 200,000 \\ncards in 1980—then moved east with Conrad Bardwell, who had been \\nHerget’s assistant in Cincinnati and relocated to Cambridge with the MPC’s \\nmove.38 Bardwell retired in 1989 and was succeeded by Gareth\\xa0Williams.\\nThe 1990s were a decade of rapid transition for the MPC. At the begin -\\nning of the decade, observations were mostly submitted by telegram, tele -\\nphone, or even on paper. By the end of the decade, nearly everything came \\nin by e-mail, and the Minor Planet Circular  had moved to the World Wide \\nWeb. In 1993, they developed a Minor Planet confirmation page to alert other \\nastronomers about newly observed objects that needed follow-up observa -\\ntions to secure orbits and provided an electronic version of the Minor Planet \\nCircular .

In the \\n19th century, the German astronomer Johann Encke studied the motion of a \\nshort-period comet—with an orbital period of only 3.3\\xa0years—over the inter -\\nval from its discovery in 1786 through 1858. He noted that the observed times \\nof perihelion passage were consistently a few hours earlier than his predic -\\ntions. To explain the comet’s early arrivals, Encke suggested that the comet’s \\norbital period was decreasing as it moved through the interplanetary resisting \\nmedium that was thought to exist at that time. During the 1835 return of \\nComet Halley, Friedrich Bessel of the Königsberg Observatory had suggested \\nthat, alternatively, the activity of this comet’s nucleus itself could introduce \\nrocket-like deviations from its normal course.44 In 1950, Fred Whipple’s \\n“dirty snowball” model for a cometary nucleus provided a likely solution to \\nthe so-called nongravitational motions of comets.45 For a rotating cometary \\nnucleus, the maximum vaporization of the cometary ices would take place at \\na position offset from the subsolar point (cometary noon). There would then \\nbe a nonradial component of thrust that would either introduce orbital energy \\n43. D. K. Yeomans, P.\\xa0W. Chodas, M.\\xa0S. Keesey, S.\\xa0J. Ostro, J.\\xa0F.

The model introduced by Marsden, \\nSekanina, and Yeomans in 1973, where the comet’s rocket-like thrusting is \\nbased upon the vaporization of water ice as a function of heliocentric distance, \\nwas quite successful and is still in use more than 40\\xa0years later.47\\nSurprisingly, inactive asteroids are also affected by nongravitational forces. \\nBecause of their “thermal inertia”—their ability to retain heat—the motions \\nof asteroids are affected by thermal reactive forces. This so-called Yarkovsky \\neffect can cause the semimajor axis of an asteroid to drift inward or outward.\\nThe Yarkovsky effect is named after Ivan Yarkovsky, a Polish civil engineer \\nworking in Russia who first introduced the concept in 1888.48 This effect \\nrefers to the nongravitational force introduced by the thermal reradiation \\nof sunlight from a rotating asteroid. Just as on Earth, midafternoon, rather \\nthan exactly noon, is the warmest part of the day, so it is for asteroids where \\nthe afternoon side of the asteroid is warmer than the subsolar point (noon). \\nAbsorbed solar radiation is re-emitted as infrared radiation (heat) with some \\ndelay. As a result, the reradiated solar energy introduces a component of thrust \\nin the direction of the asteroid’s motion (for an asteroid in prograde rotation) \\nor a component of thrust opposite to the asteroid’s motion (for an asteroid in \\nretrograde rotation). Thus, the Yarkovsky effect can either introduce an out -\\nward drift in semimajor axis for asteroids in prograde rotation (orbital energy \\nis added) or an inward spiral for asteroids in retrograde rotation (orbital \\nenergy is subtracted).

Likewise, once the pinball reaches the active pedestals and the \\nflippers at the bottom of the pinball machine, the slight decline of the pinball \\ntable is not very important.\\nComputing Earth Impact Probabilities\\nThe orbits of comets and asteroids are not perfectly known; they have errors \\nor uncertainties. For example, the astrometric data used to compute orbits are \\nnot exact; the masses of the perturbing planets are not known perfectly; and \\nthe dynamic model used to represent the object’s motion will not include all \\nperturbing bodies or effects (e.g., there may be perturbations by asteroids that \\nare not included in the dynamic model). Each of the six orbital elements for \\na body at a particular instant in time (epoch) will have associated uncertain -\\nties, and these uncertainties will change as the body’s motion is represented \\nat times different from the epoch time.59 These uncertainties are normally \\nrepresented as an ellipsoid surrounding the most likely position of the object. \\nPositions near the boundary of the uncertainty ellipsoid are far less likely \\nto be correct but are still possible. The epoch time is usually chosen close to \\nthe times for which the object has been observed, so the orbital uncertain -\\nties will usually increase for times well before, or after, the epoch time. If \\nthere is a close Earth approach of the body, the body’s uncertainty ellipsoid \\nat that close approach time can be projected onto Earth’s figure. If the body’s \\nposition uncertainty ellipsoid is entirely within Earth’s figure at the time of \\nthe closest approach, then the Earth impact probability is 100\\xa0percent—it \\nwill collide with Earth. If only a fraction of the object’s position uncertainty \\nellipsoid touches Earth’s figure, then the impact probability is equal to that \\nfraction, and if the uncertainty ellipsoid does not intersect Earth’s figure at \\n59. The orbital motion of an object, either forward or backward in time, is carried out \\non a computer by numerically integrating a second-order differential equation that \\nrepresents the combined accelerations acting upon the object at any given time. \\nThis technique then provides position and velocity vectors and their uncertainties at \\nselected time steps. At a given time, or epoch, an object’s heliocentric position and \\nvelocity vectors in space (a total of six heliocentric position and velocity components) \\ncan be converted to a corresponding set of six orbital elements—and vice versa.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='f38be6de-3ed9-4360-a539-e79c55ea0f06', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '166', 'file_name': 'a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4556385, 'creation_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_accessed_date': '2023-12-25'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, hash='dde96f905c92d595004e3aa9467b4c8c18f4d173e9c234f298e49d2b5e0563f7', text='A History of Near-Earth Objects Research166\\nall (the most likely case), then no impact is possible.60 Normally, the object’s \\norbital size and orientation in space are far better known than its position \\nalong its orbit. So an object’s uncertainty ellipsoid is most often shaped like \\nan elongated cigar, rather than a sphere, centered on the nominal position of \\nthe body. The largest position uncertainty component (the long axis of the \\ncigar) is generally in the direction of the object’s motion, or in the so-called \\n“along-track” direction. Misunderstanding this concept led to the incorrect \\nprediction for a possible Earth impact in 2028 by asteroid 1997 XF11, as we \\nsaw in chapter 5.\\nThe MPC’s move online enabled the development of automated warning \\nsoftware based on these principles late in the 1990s.

This worked by pulling data from the Minor Planet Center’s daily orbit \\nupdate pages and calculating orbit probabilities in real time. Chesley com -\\nmented that the need for “automated monitoring came up at the Torino meet -\\ning in 1999 when the second object that we found that had virtual impactors \\nwas lost. It was 1998 OX4.”61 It had been discovered on 26 July 1998 by \\nSpacewatch and then lost because nobody had realized that it was a potential \\nimpactor, and no follow-up observations had been arranged.\\nChesley and his mentor at Pisa, Andrea Milani, had conceived a way to \\nrule out a potential impact from a lost asteroid even if it was never recovered. \\nTheir “virtual impactor” method computed potential orbits that were com -\\npatible with the existing observations, projected them out for a century, and \\nthen figured out where in the sky the object would be at each of its future \\nencounters with Earth. For the lost 1998 OX4, the object would be visible \\nin particular patches of Earth’s sky in 2001 and 2003 if it was on one of the \\n60.

If it was not on an impact trajectory, it would \\nnot be found in one of those spots. Thus one could rule out a future impact by \\nlooking at these computed spaces at the appropriate time. “Negative observa -\\ntions,” as Chesley called them, were a simple, inexpensive way to retire risk. \\nAs it happened, 1998 OX4 was not observed during its potential encounter in \\n2001, and it was recovered by NEAT in August 2002.62\\nChesley moved to JPL in late 1999 and developed a similar system to \\nCLOMON/NEODyS called Sentry. While the two were similar in function, \\nSentry used different software and integration routines, so they were not iden -\\ntical. Instead, they served as checks on one another. They allowed almost \\nimmediate assessment of potential risk, overcoming some of the problems that \\nthe NEO community had encountered during the 1997 XF11 affair.\\nLess than a year after the establishment of NASA’s Near-Earth Objects \\nObservations Program in 1998, the discovery of near-Earth asteroid 1999 \\nAN10 on 13 January 1999 by LINEAR set off an analysis of the object’s \\nfuture motion by Andrea Milani, Steven Chesley, and Giovanni Valsecchi \\nthat tested review guidelines adopted by NASA and the IAU after the 1997 \\nXF11 incident.63 The asteroid was observed until 20\\xa0February, when its posi -\\ntion in the sky near that of the Sun prevented further observations. Milani \\nand colleagues noted that the asteroid would make a close approach to Earth \\nin August 2027 and that this close approach would introduce chaotic behav -\\nior such that one of the possible subsequent trajectories would bring the object \\nto an Earth approach in 2034 and again in August 2039—and for this lat -\\nter encounter, there remained a slight chance of an Earth impact. They were \\ncareful to note that the impact probability was about one in one billion and \\nthat this value was less than the probability of an impact by a similarly sized \\nunknown object within the next few hours! In short, this was an interesting \\nobject from a mathematical point of view, but not of any particular concern. \\nDuring the first two weeks of April 1999, others, including Paul Chodas at \\nJPL, verified the basic analysis by Milani and his colleagues. This was the first \\ncase in which an impact prediction was made and then vetted by professional \\ncolleagues before any public announcement.\\n62. Chesley interview, 9 March 2017; A. Milani and S.

On 13\\xa0April \\n1999, Peiser published an account in his widely read CCNET Digest inter -\\nnet forum that chided the professional astronomers, noting that “there is no \\nreason whatsoever why the findings about 1999 AN10 should not be made \\navailable to the general public—unless the findings haven’t been checked for \\ngeneral accuracy by other NEO researchers.” Peiser also speculated that one \\nreason “why the authors may have decided to hide their data could be due to \\nthe current NASA guidelines on the reporting of impact probabilities by indi -\\nvidual NEOs. After all, NASA is threatening researchers with the withdrawal \\nof funding if they dare to publish such sensitive information in any other \\nform than in a peer reviewed medium.” Peiser’s speculation was nonsense, but \\nhe did demonstrate the problem of public perception whenever Earth impact \\nstudies are conducted privately, even if the secrecy lasts only a few days and \\nthe impact risk is negligible.64\\nAt the August 2000 General Assembly of the IAU in Manchester, England, \\na NEO Technical Review Committee was approved that could review and \\nverify an Earth impact prediction during a proposed 72-hour hold on any \\nprediction release. This information hold was to be restricted to impact prob -\\nabilities greater than one in a million for the next 100 years. However, there \\nwas an obvious need for transparency, and a few sophisticated amateur orbital \\nspecialists, who could also provide impact predictions, would not be bound by \\nthe 72-hour restriction suggested by the IAU Committee.\\nA potential impactor discovered in 2000, 2000 SG344, soon rendered \\neven the 72-hour period largely irrelevant. The object was discovered by \\nDavid Tholen and Robert Whitely with the University of Hawai’i 2.2-meter \\ntelescope on 29\\xa0September 2000, and it was quickly identified as a potential \\nthreat.65 Steve Chesley remembers that it was forecast with about a 0.2 percent \\nprobability of impact in 2030 and was only a few tens of meters in size.

Moreover, the topic is provocative and prone to sensationalism. So \\nthe very real possibility of these low-probability/high-consequence events is \\nvery difficult to communicate to the public. In an effort to provide an easily \\nunderstood evaluation of a possible threat within the next 100 years, Richard \\nBinzel, at a United Nations conference in 1995, introduced a near-Earth \\nobject threat scale that took into consideration the likelihood of an upcom -\\ning impact (its impact probability) and the energy of the possible impact in \\nmegatons of TNT explosives.70 Binzel’s original index went from 0 (no col -\\nlision possible), to 1 (extremely improbable), on up to 5 (certain impact on a \\nparticular future date).71\\nSubsequently, Binzel’s index scale was modified and presented at a June \\n1999 international conference about NEOs held in Torino (Turin), Italy. The \\nnew Torino Scale, as it was renamed, ran from 0 to 10, with colors introduced \\nto represent no threat (0, white), an extremely low threat level (1, green), a \\nthreat meriting attention by astronomers (2–4, yellow), threatening (5–7, \\norange), and certain collision (8–10, red). \\nThe Torino Scale might be appropriate for public communication, but it \\ndid not convey the urgency of the event. Would the possible impact occur \\nin several decades or several weeks? To provide a scale more useful to the \\nscientific community for prioritizing objects for additional observations and \\nanalysis, Steven Chesley and his colleagues introduced a scale that sought to \\ninclude the time proximity as well as the impact probability and potential \\nimpact energy. In honor of the 2001 international conference on NEOs held \\nin Palermo, Italy, this threat scale for professionals was named the Palermo \\n70. See the glossary for the definitions used in this text. It is worth noting that Binzel \\nand many others refer to his scale as a hazard scale, but as it refers to a specific object \\nand not the entire population of NEOs (the definition of “hazard”), we refer to it \\nas a threat scale in accordance with the Planetary Defense Coordination Office’s \\ndefinitions.

There are two reasons for this. Before 1990, \\nfewer than 150 near-Earth asteroids were known, compared to the thousands \\nof main-belt asteroids available for study. More importantly, as was outlined \\nin chapter 6, near-Earth asteroids dynamically evolve from the main belt, so \\nthe physical characterization of main-belt asteroids is directly relevant to the \\nsubclass of near-Earth asteroids.

Hence, most asteroid diameter estimates begin with a \\ndetermination of the asteroid’s absolute magnitude, and then a likely albedo is \\nassumed to estimate the diameter—a process that can lead to large uncertain -\\nties in their size estimates.\\nFor a small number of asteroids, the diameter can be directly inferred \\nfrom stellar occultation measurements, whereby observers in diverse locations \\nobserve and record the time intervals when the starlight blinks out (or not) \\nas the asteroid passes in front of (or near) the star. With observers located at \\nslightly different latitudes and a knowledge of the asteroid’s orbital motion in \\nspace, the recorded occultation time intervals can be converted to linear chord \\nmeasures (or at least partial measures) of the asteroid’s two-dimensional shape. \\nThis technique was well known as early as 1952, when MIT’s Gordon Taylor \\nbegan issuing predictions, but limited opportunities to observe occultations \\nand a lack of equipment and observers meant progress was very slow. Only \\nthree occultation-observing programs were carried out between 1952 and the \\nend of 1974 (one for Juno and two for Pallas). By 1989, there were about 30 \\nasteroids for which some estimates of occultation diameters were available.3\\nAlternately, an object’s albedo (and hence size) can be determined from \\npolarization measurements taken at several different phase angles. For a par -\\nticular asteroid, the ascending slope of the curve found when plotting percent -\\nage polarization against phase angle is inversely proportional to its geometric \\nalbedo. That is, the darker the albedo, the more quickly the percentage polar -\\nization increases with increasing phase angle.4 The first asteroid polarization \\n1.

Morrison found the distribution of geometric \\nalbedos to be bimodal, with peaks at about 0.035 and 0.15, corresponding to \\nthe C (carbonaceous) and S (silicaceous) spectral types respectively.11\\nThese techniques were almost entirely carried out on large main-belt \\nasteroids, but since astronomers considered the main belt to be the source of \\nplanet-crossing asteroids (via gravitational perturbations), they were directly \\nrelevant to estimating the sizes of near-Earth asteroids, too. Morrison’s 1973 \\nwork included only one NEO (433 Eros), an Amor-class asteroid, which he \\nestimated at about 24 kilometers in diameter. Many years later, he commented \\nthat “when I was doing the observations at Maunakea, there simply weren’t \\nNEOs available. At least I didn’t know about them. There were darn few, \\nand very few that would be bright enough to observe even with the Infrared \\nTelescope Facility”12—a facility yet to be built in 1973.\\nThe standard thermal model, which assumed no thermal inertia (i.e., slow \\nrotators), was quite successful for the large main-belt asteroids that were the \\ntargets of most of the early infrared observations.

In 1974, to avoid an unrealistic standard thermal model assumption \\nthat an asteroid radiates all of its heat isotropically on the day side, Morrison \\nand Terry J.

With no tensile strength, \\nany asteroids rotating more rapidly would fly apart.49 Petr Pravec of the Czech \\nRepublic’s Astronomical Institute and JPL’s Alan Harris expanded upon this \\nconcept in a 2000 paper.50 The discovery of small asteroids (e.g., 1995 HM \\nand 1998 KY26) spinning faster than the 2.2-hour limit led them to sug -\\ngest that monolithic asteroids, under stress and with tensile strength, could \\nbe abundant among the smaller asteroids. Fast-rotating asteroids in the size \\nrange of 200 meters to 10\\xa0kilometers tended to have smaller light-curve ampli -\\ntudes (nearly spherical shapes) as their spin rates increased, which the authors \\nclaimed provided further evidence for their rubble-pile structure. That is, any \\nfragment on the end of an elongated body would be the first to be lost to a \\nfast-rotating body. Asteroids larger than about 200 meters were thought to \\nbe loosely bound rubble piles with negligible tensile strength to hold them \\ntogether.

Hence these larger asteroids could be either monolithic or rubble \\npiles. Holsapple also pointed out that for small asteroids below a few kilome -\\nters in diameter that are dominated by strength considerations, they could \\nrotate considerably faster than the 2.2-hour limit if they had only a modest \\namount of tensile strength.51 In 2014, Paul Sánchez and Dan Scheeres, at the \\nUniversity of Colorado, noted that van der Waals surface attractions between \\nthe finest material grains in a rubble pile could provide the modest cohesive \\nattraction necessary to hold small, rapidly rotating rubble-pile fragments in \\nplace.52 Thus the neat rubble-pile dichotomy began to fall apart.\\nMeanwhile, another factor quickly become apparent: whether or not an \\nasteroid is a rubble pile also has to do with its collisional history. There are more \\nthan 20 asteroid families—groups of asteroids that share the same orbital and \\nspectral properties and are thought to have originated from the collisional dis -\\nruption of a larger body.

Conversely, if the ejection velocities were high \\nenough for the fragments to escape the parent body after the collision, the \\nresulting fragment size distribution did not match that of observed family \\nmembers because no large fragment was created.\\n51.

In the 1970s, there were a number of spurious reports \\nof asteroid satellites based upon anomalous light curves or blinkouts during \\nstellar occultation observations.56 The search for satellites continued into the \\n1980s using asteroid light-curve analysis and radar observations, along with \\ndirect telescopic imaging using CCD devices, but, by the end of the 1980s, \\nasteroid satellites were considered nonexistent or at least extremely rare.57\\nThe thinking changed dramatically in August 1993 after the Galileo \\nspacecraft, en route to its orbital tour of Jupiter, flew past main-belt asteroid \\n243 Ida and imaged a small 1.5-kilometer satellite orbiting the 31-kilometer \\nS-type primary. The discovery was made by Galileo Imaging Team member \\nAnn Harch; Dactyl, as it was to be named, showed for the first time that \\nasteroids can have satellites. After the Galileo discovery, several asteroid sat -\\nellites were identified, mostly using direct ground-based telescopic imaging \\nwith adaptive optics, photometric light-curve analysis, or radar observations. \\nThe first radar discovery of a near-Earth asteroid satellite was 2000 DP107, \\nwhich was observed by the Goldstone and Arecibo radars in September and \\nOctober 2000. The 300-meter-sized satellite revolved about the 800-meter-\\nsized primary with an orbital period of 1.755 days. Using this orbital period \\nplus the semimajor axis of the satellite around the primary, Kepler’s third law \\nallowed a mass determination for the primary.58 In turn, the mass divided \\nby an estimate of the primary’s volume—determined from the radar shape \\nmodel—provided a bulk density estimate of about 1.7 grams per cubic \\n56.

The principal axes of the “head” and “body” have \\ndifferent orientations, suggesting that they were once separate bodies that com -\\nbined after a slow collision into a rough rubble-pile structure. The paucity of \\ncraters is attributed to impact-induced resurfacing, and its rubble-pile nature \\ncan explain its low bulk density, high porosity, boulder-rich appearance, and \\nbi-lobed shape.99 Infrared and x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy experiments \\ndetermined that Itokawa was probably chondritic in composition.100\\nOf the nearly 1,600 tiny dust particles that were brought back for study, \\ntwo-thirds were silicate mineral grains made up of only olivine, only pyrox -\\nene, or only feldspar. The remaining (mostly silicate) grains were polyminer -\\nalic.101 The samples were a match to ordinary chondritic material, offering a \\nfinal confirmation that the common S-type asteroids are indeed the source of \\nthe most common meteorites, the ordinary chondrites.\\nThe Hayabusa sample analyses also shed light on the likely thermal history \\nand formation of Itokawa. When the Itokawa parent body condensed from \\nthe solar nebula, some of its constituent atoms were short-lived radioactive \\nisotopes like aluminum-26 (26Al). As the proto-asteroid accumulated more \\nmaterial, including more 26Al, it continued to heat up as these radioactive \\natoms decayed.102 The asteroid likely reached a temperature of about 800°C \\nbefore it began a long-term cooling phase as the 26Al was depleted. As the \\nasteroid temperature would have increased with depth, an original parent \\nbody of at least 20 kilometers would have been required to generate some of \\nItokawa’s silicate grains.103 This slow-cooking process formed the crystalline \\nsilicate particles, like olivine, that are ubiquitous in asteroids and cometary \\ndust. Tomoki Nakamura noted that, based upon the Hayabusa dust particle \\nanalysis, “…the Itokawa parent S-class asteroid was originally much larger, \\nexperienced intense thermal metamorphism, and was then catastrophically \\n 99.

Since the team’s charter required a cost-benefit analysis, \\nthe group had to identify the key risk that they would address, figure out \\nhow to place a cost on that risk, and compare it to the cost of a search system \\ndesigned to reduce the risk. As Yeomans put it during the discussion, “we \\nneed to predict damage cost of such an impact, to compare with the benefit \\nof doing the\\xa0search.”9\\nThis task went beyond the population models that Harris and others had \\nbeen making. Risk assessment and cost-benefit analysis meant having to assess \\nwhat damage would be done by which kinds of impacts—a problem that was \\nnot well understood. At the second meeting, discussion focused on how to \\nfigure this out. Pete Worden commented that nuclear weapons tests were not \\nnecessarily very informative since they had not been designed to address a key \\nquestion: what size of asteroid should be the threshold for the new goal? Not \\nhaving been carried out to “almost but not quite” cause damage to the surface, \\nnuclear weapons tests did little to define a lower limit to destructive potential. \\nThere had also not been much study of the possibility that impacts at sea \\ncould cause tsunamis. William Bottke of the Southwest Research Institute \\nwas aware of a 1968 report that indicated that nuclear weapons were not par -\\nticularly effective at initiating tsunamis, but that was it. Harris commented at \\nthis meeting that this kind of natural-hazard analysis for cosmic impacts was \\nmostly a hobby, as no one funded it.10\\nThe Science Definition Team considered the tsunami issue to be the least \\nwell understood and decided to hold a special workshop to help the team \\ndevelop a better understanding of it. Asteroid impacts were unlike the great \\nearthquakes that generally produce tsunamis because they would generate \\nshorter-wavelength waves, but these would still have longer wavelengths than \\nthe other very common kind of waves, those driven by winds. So there were \\nno direct, and valid, analogies available. Two very divergent opinions on the \\nmatter emerged. One view was that the relatively short wavelengths of impact-\\ngenerated waves would cause them to break far out on continental shelves and \\n 8.

Another analysis had found the oppo -\\nsite—giant waves that, as JPL’s Steven Chesley remembered, would roll up the \\nAppalachian mountains. (This scenario tended to show up in asteroid-impact \\nmovies.) A third analysis had found a fairly significant effect for impactors of \\n200–300 meters in size, based on analysis of the energy remaining in the water \\nafter dissipation of some of the energy in breaking on continental shelves.11 \\n“The water has to go somewhere,” Chesley commented later.12 In the opin -\\nion of the group, however, that analysis had overestimated the frequency of \\nimpacts by quite a bit, so Chesley worked with the study’s lead author, Steven \\nWard of the University of California, Santa Cruz, to publish a new analysis \\nusing more representative asteroid population numbers.13\\nOne ground rule the team adopted was to consider only the subset of \\nasteroids that were potentially hazardous, meaning that their orbits had a \\nsmall chance of intersecting Earth’s in the next few hundred years. These \\nwere known as PHAs, “Potentially Hazardous Asteroids.” Only about 20 per -\\ncent of the known NEOs met this definition.14 Stokes put it bluntly in one \\npresentation: “PHAs represent the collision danger—the rest are chaff,” he \\nsaid.15 They also concluded early on that comets represented much less hazard \\nthan previously thought. Yeomans’s analysis showed that long-period comets \\nrepresented only about a percent of the overall impact risk since, in near-Earth \\nspace, asteroids outnumber comets by more than 100 to\\xa01.\\nWhen the SDT members had resolved all of their questions about risk, \\nthey found that the hazard due to PHAs effectively broke into four size \\ndomains.

The technology for optical space -\\nborne telescopes was more readily available.19\\nThat decision then led the SDT into a discussion of orbits. One possibility \\nwas a Venus-trailing orbit that would look back toward Earth.

So they decided to carry into their \\ncost-benefit analysis only the low-Earth orbit (LEO), L2, and Venus-trailing \\nmission concepts, though the SDT also analyzed several variants of these, \\nwith different telescope apertures.21\\nFor dedicated ground-based NEO survey telescopes, the SDT explored a \\nvariety of different apertures from 1 meter to 8 meters, different CCD pixel \\nsizes, different locations, and different numbers of telescopes, via a Lincoln \\nLaboratory simulation tool called the Fast Resident Object Surveillance \\nSimulation Tool (FROSST). Much of that modeling work was done by Jenifer \\nEvans of the MIT Lincoln Laboratory, who was also a member of the SDT. \\nThere was quite a bit of discussion of search strategies and of the issue of loca -\\ntion—the Tucson, Arizona, area or Maunakea, Hawai’i—which turned out \\nstrongly in favor of Maunakea. The “seeing,” or stability of the atmosphere \\nthat a telescope would look through, and weather on Maunakea were so \\nmuch better that using Hawai’i represented a halving of telescope aperture—\\na 2-meter telescope on Maunakea could perform as well as a 4-meter telescope \\nin Arizona. This situation affected the cost profoundly; Hawai’i was a more \\nexpensive location in which to build observatories, but the smaller telescope \\nwould still be less expensive overall.22\\nThe Science Definition Team’s risk analysis led them to the conclusion \\nthat the new goal for NEO hazard reduction should be to “construct a search \\nsystem that is capable of retiring 90% of the risk  posed by collisions with \\nasteroids whose diameters are less than one kilometer” (emphasis added).23 \\nIntegrating the unknown hazard presented by the various object sizes gave \\nthem the result: 90\\xa0percent of the remaining hazard would be eliminated by \\ncataloging 90\\xa0percent of the objects more than 140 meters in diameter.\\nOnce they had determined their goal, the SDT evaluated the performance \\nof the myriad of potential survey systems.

As Tholen tells the story, he had been \\nadvocating looking for near-Earth asteroids near the Sun during the 2 hours \\nafter sunset and before sunrise because the surveys being carried out at the \\ntime avoided this region. The telescopes in use at the time would not find \\nmuch there, partly because the asteroids would not be fully illuminated by \\nthe Sun (they would appear as small crescents, if our eyes could resolve them \\nat all), and partly because whatever telescope was being used would have to be \\nlooking near the horizon, where there is more air between the telescope and \\nspace, and therefore more scattering of the available light. The seeing, in other \\nwords, would not be as good as if the same telescope were looking at the point \\nin the sky directly opposite the Sun (which is called opposition). Because the \\nsurveys had all been focused on opposition and the simulated asteroid popula -\\ntion models were built and checked against the survey data, the population \\nmodels were biased toward asteroids with most of their orbit further from the \\nSun than Earth. But Tholen could not think of any reason why there would \\nnot be asteroids sunward of Earth—they would just be harder to find. “That \\ndoesn’t appear physical to me,” he said in 2017. “You’d have to assume that the \\nEarth is sweeping up everything  in order to prevent anything from propagat -\\ning inward, and that just seems so unphysical to me.”26\\nIn 2002, NASA’s Thomas Morgan had funded a three-year proposal of \\nTholen’s to do some observing with a new 8k CCD camera that was to be \\nbuilt for the University of Hawai’i 2.2-meter telescope on Maunakea. But \\nthere were delays in finishing the camera, so eventually Tholen got time on \\nthe 8.2-meter Subaru telescope. He and Bernardi found a fast-moving object \\non the second of the two nights they had on that telescope, 17 June (universal \\ntime). Since they could not follow up on it right away from the Subaru tele -\\nscope but had scheduled time on Kitt Peak’s 90-inch telescope, they contacted \\nRoy Tucker at the University of Arizona and asked him to look for it. They \\nthen flew to Arizona too. Tucker found an object within the observing field \\nthat was moving at the right speed, according to specifications that Tholen \\nhad e-mailed him, but not quite in the right spot. After a second night of \\nobservations, they sent the data to the Minor Planet Center on the 20th. \\n26.

The issue Chesley had to answer was really one of time: \\nwhat decisions would have to be made, and when? Apophis’s orbit around \\nthe Sun was slightly larger than Earth’s (with a somewhat longer period), \\nbut not greatly so. In the years before the 2029 encounter, it would cross \\nEarth’s orbit several more times. During some of those orbits, it would be \\ninvisible from Earth; during others, it would be visible to telescopes but not to \\nradar; in still others, it would be close enough to make radar measurements. \\nChesley predicted that the Arecibo radar would be able to observe Apophis \\nin May 2006, February and July 2013, and October 2020; even without tele -\\nscopic observations (for which there were more opportunities) or the tran -\\nsponder mission, these would reduce the uncertainty of the orbit solutions for \\n2029\\xa0considerably.36\\nChesley also evaluated what the best timing would be for a transponder \\nmission, if one were to be necessary. In an important sense, knowledge of a \\nplanetary body’s orbit decays if the body is not observed frequently. Partly, \\nthat is simply due to unavoidable errors in the observations (no instrument is \\nperfect), but it is also because there are small forces that cannot be measured \\neasily that affect the motions of the bodies. In the case of asteroids, one impor -\\ntant small force is the Yarkovsky effect, explained in chapter 6. From one orbit \\nto the next, this effect makes little difference, but across many orbits, it could \\nhave a large effect. Therefore, if the Apophis tracking mission were initiated \\ntoo early—perhaps launching in 2008 and ending a year or two later—it \\nwould not actually provide the uncertainty reduction Schweickart expected.\\nChesley modeled how the uncertainty in knowledge of 99942 Apophis’s \\norbit would evolve, both with and without the expected future radar data, in \\norder to figure out what point in time would be optimal for launching a one-\\nyear tracking mission. He found that the tracking mission should reach the \\nasteroid in 2019. Since it would take four years to develop and launch such \\na mission, a decision to do it did not have to be made until after the 2013 \\nArecibo radar observations.37 That made the 2013 radar observations rather \\n36.

One new facility considered in the OPAE study was the \\nLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) that had helped motivate the 2003 \\nScience Definition Team study; another, the Panoramic Survey Telescope \\nand Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS), was under development by the \\nUniversity of Hawai’i’s Institute for Astronomy. These were quite different \\ndesigns, though they shared a common purpose: each intended to do wide-\\nfield, repeat imaging of the entire accessible sky. Cosmologist Nick Kaiser \\nof the Institute for Astronomy, who led the initial design of Pan-STARRS, \\nexplained later that “what we were arguing was, there was a better way to do \\nwide-field imaging, which wasn’t to build a single big telescope, but to build \\nan array of small telescopes.”43 While LSST was to be an 8-meter-aperture, \\nsingle-mirror telescope designed for a 10-degree field of view and a gigapixel-\\nscale camera, Pan-STARRS was to be a network of 1.8-meter telescopes with \\nlarge cameras. Neither was intended primarily for asteroid hunting, though. \\n40. NASA Authorization Act, Pub. L.

But their advocates were \\nalways quick to point out that their data would contribute to many other areas \\nin astronomy, including asteroid surveys.\\nIn Congress, Pan-STARRS had an ally in Senator Daniel Inouye of \\nHawai’i, and this gave it an edge over LSST. Inouye, first elected to the \\nSenate in 1963, was able to fund the first Pan-STARRS telescope’s construc -\\ntion via an earmark in the Air Force budget. Pan-STARRS 1 was being built \\non an existing site on Haleakalā, Maui, as a functioning prototype for the \\noperational array of four telescopes, which were to be built on Maunakea. \\nAs the congressionally mandated study was being set up, Pan-STARRS 1’s \\nteam expected to have the telescope in operation in 2007. But at this stage \\nof its planning, Pan-STARRS 1’s team intended most of the telescope’s time \\nto be allocated to imaging the entire visible sky 10 to 20 times in five color \\nfilters (known as the 3π Steradian Survey).44 Only about 10 percent of the \\ntelescope’s time was to be dedicated specifically to NEOs.\\nThe OPAE study, which Johnson named the Analysis of Alternatives study \\n(or AOA), had two main thrusts. The first was its review of survey alternatives, \\nwhich came to somewhat different conclusions than had Grant Stokes’s 2003 \\nScience Definition Team. If only ground systems were considered, only one \\noption for reaching the 2020 goal existed: building a copy of LSST dedicated \\nonly to the NEO hunt, and sharing the planned Pan-STARRS 4 (as the full \\nquad-telescope system was known) and LSST itself. This had a life-cycle cost \\nof $820 million. If the deadline were extended to 2024, two other ground-\\nbased options would exist: in one, an eight-telescope version of Pan-STARRS \\nplus sharing of Pan-STARRS 4 and LSST could do it for a cost of $560 mil -\\nlion. In the other, a dedicated “LSST-like” observatory could do it, but for \\n$870 million.45\\nIn considering space-based survey options, the AOA study emphasized \\ninfrared telescopes over optical, reversing the earlier SDT decision. This deci -\\nsion was made partly because of newly available technology, but also because \\nthey interpreted the congressional language as requiring characterization of \\n44. K. C. Chambers, E. A.

Since a factor of 2 error in size meant up to a \\nfactor of 8 error in mass, getting more accurate mass estimates earlier would \\nmake a big difference in planning an asteroid deflection effort, should one be \\ndeemed necessary. So, while the space-based infrared telescopes would all cost \\nmore than the ground-based options and had higher technical and cost risks, \\nthey were rated highly. Here the telescopes in Venus-like orbits dominated \\nthe analysis because they would eliminate the observational bias produced by \\nEarth-based telescopes’ inability to survey efficiently near the Sun.46\\nThe second thrust of the AOA study concerned the deflection of asteroid \\nthreats. Clearly motivated by 99942 Apophis, this section emphasized the \\nability to respond to relatively near-term threats. The team analyzed various \\nscenarios involving the use of nuclear and conventional explosives, kinetic \\nimpactors, and what they called “slow push” techniques—primarily a gravity \\ntractor and a “space tug.” Other techniques that did not necessarily involve \\nsending spacecraft to the asteroid in question were mentioned, such as focus -\\ning lasers or mirrors on it to impart an impulse, but they were not analyzed. \\nThe key issue for deflecting an asteroid lies in the amount of velocity change \\nthat must be imposed to change an asteroid’s orbit enough to miss Earth, \\nand for a given launch mass, nuclear devices could produce the most change. \\nThey also carried the most risk of fragmenting the body, which would compli -\\ncate the mitigation problem enormously. Nevertheless, nuclear options domi -\\nnated the analysis, as they had during the 1992 deflection study involving the \\nnational laboratories.\\nThat emphasis on nuclear options made the resulting document controver -\\nsial, and NASA leadership did not help matters when they initially refused to \\nrelease the full study. It was deemed too detailed for a congressional response, \\nand instead of the full 275-page study, Congress was sent a 28-page sum -\\nmary that included what amounted to a dismissal of the entire enterprise: \\n“NASA recommends that the program continue as currently planned, and we \\nwill also take advantage of opportunities using potential-dual-use telescopes \\nand spacecraft—and partner with other agencies as feasible—to attempt to \\n46.

However, due to current budget \\nconstraints, NASA cannot initiate a new program at this time.”47\\nNASA officials quickly changed their minds about not releasing the full \\nreport, perhaps because it was already circulating in an electronic draft any -\\nway. But rather than finishing the report, they provided the unfinished draft \\nwith several pages of errata appended to it. These covered some, though not all, \\nof the draft’s problems. The tactic did not save them from loud public criticism.\\nRusty Schweickart and Clark Chapman, via the B612 Foundation, both \\nwrote detailed technical criticisms, released them to the public, and sent them \\nto the NASA Administrator. Schweickart’s critique focused on the choice of \\nexample deflection cases. The study team had chosen Apophis and another \\nfew-hundred-meter-class asteroid, (144898) 2004 VD17, which had a poten -\\ntial impact in 2102. These were unrepresentative of the actual threat, he con -\\ntended, which would largely come from smaller asteroids that did not require \\nthe high impulse of nuclear devices. He also thought that there were many \\nmore “keyholes” that a high-impulse blast might shove the asteroid into, \\navoiding an imminent impact threat only to increase the odds of a later one.48 \\nIn essence, he was arguing that nuclear devices were too crude a tool to use \\nfor deflection. More finesse was in order, and the slow-push techniques were \\nmore appropriate.\\nClark Chapman’s critique focused on the nuclear issue too, though from \\na different perspective. The report’s authors had, in his opinion, chosen the \\nnuclear option first and then worked from there toward a conclusion that this \\noption required the least knowledge about the specific asteroid to be deflected. \\nThat view he considered absurd; one would still need to know mass, whether \\nthe asteroid was solid or a “rubble pile,” whether it was rapidly tumbling or \\nnot, etc. The core flaw of the document, though, was its assumption that \\nmaximal impulse was best.\\n47.

Their first attempts to extract NEOs from \\nthe telescope’s imagery failed because they relied only on pairs of images, \\nwhich resulted in high numbers of false positives. LINEAR used five images \\nfor that reason, and as did NEOWISE. In September 2010, they switched to \\nfour images (the number used by the Catalina Sky Survey) and were imme -\\ndiately successful at finding NEOs, though not particularly efficient at it at \\nfirst.57 IfA astronomer Richard Wainscoat, who led the asteroid portion of the \\nsurvey, explained that their initial observing plan had been to search near the \\nSun, the largely unobserved region in which Tucker and Tholen had found \\nApophis, but that did not work out. Wainscoat commented in 2017 that “the \\n‘sweet spots’ turned out to be difficult, because the trade-winds blow out of \\nthe direction of the northeast, which is where the sweet spot is going to be \\nin the morning.”58 The winds hit Haleakalā crater and create turbulence that \\nhinders seeing, in addition to the other known problems of observing near \\nthe Sun. As the other surveys already had, Pan-STARRS shifted to mostly \\nopposition surveys to increase its discovery rate.\\nPan-STARRS also suffered from another thorny problem: the lack of \\nadequate follow-up observations, particularly for objects in the southern sky. \\nPan-STARRS observations were largely automated, but the data mining of \\nthe images was not quite real-time; without a human in the processing loop, \\nit could not do same-night follow-up of new discoveries, as the Catalina Sky \\nSurvey did. Waiting until the next night meant that some objects were never \\nspotted again; Tholen was funded by the NEO Observations Program to \\nperform follow-up for Pan-STARRS and others using the Canada-France-\\nHawai’i telescope on Maunakea, but as the Pan-STARRS’s discovery rate \\nincreased, that effort was overwhelmed.

These \\nrapid scans would capture only relatively bright (and therefore only very large \\nor very close) asteroids, so they would not contribute much to the Brown Act \\nsurvey goal. But such a system would provide early warning at relatively small \\ncost. The telescopes would be small, 0.4 meters or so, and fully automated.\\nTonry explained later that he was trying to figure out “how best to build \\nthe optimal survey system per unit dollar.” He was less interested in the aster -\\noid task per se than in the larger astronomical goal of transient events, which, \\nbecause of the Pan-STARRS program’s relatively slow pace, he thought \\nwas not being well-served. ATLAS would not have Pan-STARRS’s depth, \\nbut it could survey the sky much more rapidly.

If one wished to send astronauts to a near-Earth asteroid, one had \\nto find a NEO that was close enough to be reached and large enough to \\nbe landed on, but not spinning too rapidly. And that meant spending more \\nmoney on NEO discovery and characterization despite the overall shrink -\\nage of the Agency’s budget. The NASA NEO Observations Program’s budget \\nwent from $3.7 million in fiscal year 2009 to $40.5 million in fiscal year \\n2014. These budget increases allowed Johnson to take over the funding of \\nPan-STARRS after 2014 and WISE’s reactivation as NEOWISE in 2011, as \\nwell as funding some technology development efforts at JPL in support of a \\nproposal by Amy Mainzer to develop a mission optimized for NEO discovery \\nand characterization called NEOCam.

These studies in turn \\ndrew attention to two new objectives: human exploration of asteroids and \\nexploitation of their natural resources. Both ideas were rooted in science fic -\\ntion, an early example being Garett P.

Percival Lowell, for example, wrote in 1906 about one phase of the \\nprocess he believed to be the reason behind his “canals”: “Study of the several \\nplanets of our solar system, notably the Earth, Moon, and Mars, reveals toler -\\nably legibly an interesting phase of a planet’s career, which apparently must \\nhappen to all such bodies, and evidently has happened or is happening to \\nthese three: the transition of its surface from a terraqueous to a purely ter -\\nrestrial condition.”3 If Mars was in transition from a vibrant Earth-like planet \\nto a lifeless Moon-like one, then this evolutionary path would eventually take \\nits course on our own planet. As Robert Markley traces in his book Dying \\nPlanet: Mars in Science and the Imagination , this theme of loss and dwindling \\nresources played out in both science fiction and environmental concerns of \\nthe day. These anxieties persisted and would later be rekindled by the 1972 \\n“Limits to Growth” report by the Club of Rome, which sparked a wave of \\nmodern interest in the prospect of space colonization as an alternative to ter -\\nrestrial disaster.4 In contrast to the specter of resource depletion at home, the \\nseeming abundance of valuable space resources allowed for a ready compari -\\nson between the cold reaches of space and the American frontier, where new \\nresources could always be found. By the middle of the century, the archetype \\nof the asteroid miner as explorer and frontiersman was well established in the \\nrealm of science fiction, and in the decades that followed, a surge of enthu -\\nsiasm for space settlement and resource utilization pushed to bring the sci-fi  \\ntrope of conquering the final frontier into reality. “Without a frontier to grow \\nin,” wrote space advocate Robert Zubrin in 1994, “not only American society, \\nbut the entire global civilization based upon Western enlightenment values of \\nhumanism, reason, science and progress will die.”5\\nThus, neither asteroid exploration nor resource extraction was a new idea, \\nbut both gained currency decades later when framed as the opportunity to \\ndevelop multi-use technologies in support of planetary defense.

Two key issues emerged during this time. One was simply that very \\nfew potential asteroid targets were known. A short study of possible candi -\\ndates that might be listed in the Minor Planet Center and JPL small bod -\\nies databases was performed to make a list of potential candidates, and very \\nquickly the Small Bodies Assessment Group (SBAG) began advocating for an \\nexpanded asteroid search program.38 More seriously for the human mission \\npotential, though, was the simple fact that going to an asteroid meant spend -\\ning months in space, and that meant that a long-duration habitat needed to be \\ndesigned. But nothing like that fit into NASA’s future budget profile.\\nSoon after the President’s announcement in 2010, a study organized by \\nelectric propulsion engineer John Brophy at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory \\n(JPL) was initiated to consider the feasibility of capturing a small near-Earth \\nasteroid and bringing it back to the International Space Station (ISS) using \\nhigh-power solar-electric propulsion (SEP), a near-term technology then \\nunder development.39 While the study found several challenges, its primary \\nconclusion was that “no show stoppers were identified for the approach that \\nwould return an entire 10,000-kg asteroid to the ISS in a mission that could \\nbe launched by the end of this decade.”40\\nLouis D. Friedman of the Planetary Society then entered the picture. An \\nintern at the Society, Marco Tantardini, was very interested in asteroid science \\nand became an advocate; they contacted Martin Lo, a trajectory designer at \\nJPL, who invited Brophy to help run a follow-on study of asteroid retrieval at \\n38.

This \\nmuch shorter mission would not require the development of a long-duration \\nhabitat. This study, summarized in a final report released in April 2012, show -\\ncased a shift in the defense-centered rhetoric of previous decades.42 Rather than \\nresource development and exploration goals offered as a spinoff of planetary \\ndefense, the KISS asteroid retrieval mission touted fully multi-use technologies, \\navailable for human exploration, resource exploitation, and hazard mitigation. \\nThe crux of it would be the development of a very large solar-electric propulsion \\nmodule to move the asteroid.43 In addition to meeting the President’s goal of \\nsending astronauts to an asteroid by 2025, it would offer a cost-effective oppor -\\ntunity to gain valuable human operational experience in space that could trans -\\nlate to much longer missions to more distant NEOs. It would also represent a \\nnew kind of partnership between robotic and crewed missions: one partner to \\nretrieve the asteroid and the other to explore and process its materials. In addi -\\ntion, having a near-Earth asteroid parked in lunar orbit would allow in-depth \\nstudies of its structure and composition that could prove invaluable to a future \\ndeflection effort. Finally, such an achievement would garner national prestige \\nand inspire the nation. “It would be mankind’s first attempt at modifying the \\nheavens to enable the permanent settlement of humans in space.”44\\nThis emphasis on multi-use technologies was carried through into what \\nbecame the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM).

And gravity is a function of mass. So the combined space -\\ncraft/boulder would impose a larger gravitational attraction on the asteroid \\nthan the spacecraft alone would have. The combination should be able to alter \\nthe asteroid’s trajectory more rapidly, too.\\nThe enhanced gravity tractor demonstration was to occupy the mission \\nfor most of a year once the spacecraft reached its target asteroid. After pick -\\ning up a convenient rock, the spacecraft would be directed to a “halo” orbit \\none asteroid radius from the surface. It would remain in that state for 30–90 \\ndays, then move farther away while scientists on the ground verified that it \\nhad, in fact, slightly altered the asteroid’s orbit. This phase would last for four \\nto five months. Then the spacecraft would be ordered to its final destination, \\na lunar\\xa0orbit.58\\nThe ARM concept was an opportunity to develop new technologies and \\ncapabilities that would be useful across a variety of areas, including everything \\nfrom rendezvous and landing to planetary defense, from autonomous opera -\\ntions to resource mining.

The asteroid had been large enough to create a dense dust \\ncloud, captured on numerous cell phone images.

Conversely, if the asteroid was on a colli -\\nsion trajectory, then the 2012–13 observation opportunities would raise the \\nimpact probability to 10–15\\xa0percent, and the 2015–16 observations to “around \\n70%.”17 Since observations in the next few years were likely to be definitive, \\nno deflection decision needed to be made yet.

In 2016, Davide \\nFarnocchia and his JPL colleagues developed the Scout system, designed \\nto provide the earliest possible warning for short-term impacts and close \\napproaches of newly discovered objects.21 Scout takes advantage of the Minor \\nPlanet Center’s NEO Confirmation web page (NEOCP), which posts the \\nposition observations of newly discovered, potential near-Earth objects.

The committee there -\\nfore concluded that the “optimal approach” starts with a research program.26\\nThe committee also argued that this research program should not be \\nfunded from existing science budgets. “Because this is a policy-driven, applied \\nprogram, it should not be in competition with basic scientific research pro -\\ngrams or funded from them.”27 In other words, this group was arguing that \\ncosmic impact mitigation research was not a scientific priority. It was “applied research.” To this point, all NEO research funding had come from NASA’s \\nplanetary science funds, and researchers wanted this to stop. Their view was that planetary defense should not come at the expense of planetary science; it \\nshould have its own funding.\\nThe NRC contended that there were four key areas upon which NASA \\nshould focus its mitigation research program. One of these had not been addressed in the earlier studies: civil defense. The most likely form of Earth \\nimpact would come from smaller asteroids, which would explode while still airborne, as the 1908 Tunguska bolide and 2008 TC3 had done. For those, \\nshelter-in-place strategies, evacuation plans, and survivable emergency infra -\\nstructure would all provide life-saving support in a cost-efficient manner. \\nThese smaller impacts would occur every couple of centuries, on average. The \\nnecessary procedures and infrastructure would also be valuable in the event \\nof even larger impacts.\\n28\\nThe other three areas involved in-space capabilities. Slow-push methods \\nwere recognized to be the most controllable techniques for diverting small \\nasteroids with a sufficiently advanced warning time of decades. Of these, the \\ngravity tractor was identified as the method least sensitive to the variations in physical characteristics of the asteroid and by far the most technologically fea -\\nsible. Kinetic impactors were also determined to be adequate deflection tech -\\nniques for NEOs up to 1 kilometer in diameter, again with years to decades of lead time. This method had the added advantage that the ability to hit an \\nasteroid with a spacecraft had recently been demonstrated in space during \\n26. NRC, Defending Planet Earth , p. 4.\\n27.

The authors recommended that if Congress wished to fund “mitiga-\\ntion research at an appropriately high leve l,” first priority should be testing a  \\nkinetic impactor with an accompanying characterization effort.30\\nThe final area of interest outlined in the study focused on nuclear deflec -\\ntion techniques. Echoing the language of prior deflection studies, the report \\nfound that “[o]ther than a large flotilla (100 or more) of massive spacecraft \\nbeing sent as impactors, nuclear explosions are the only current, practical \\nmeans for changing the orbit of large NEOs (diameter greater than about one \\nkilometer). Nuclear explosions also remain as a backup strategy for somewhat \\nsmaller objects if other methods have failed. They may be the only method \\nfor dealing with smaller objects when warning time is short, but additional \\nresearch is necessary for such cases .”31 This group contended that the most \\neffective approach would be the use of nuclear stand-off detonations, relying \\nprimarily on the neutron radiation produced by the device to heat and vapor -\\nize the asteroid ’s surface material. The resulting ejecta jet would produce the \\ndesired velocity change. If necessar y, a succession of stand-off devices could be \\nused over several years to shift a particularly large impactor ’s orbit. This might \\nalso be necessary if an impactor appeared to be particularly fragile.\\nFollowing the release of Defending Planet Earth , the White House Office \\nof Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) responded to the congressional \\nmandate that had been included in the 2008 NASA Authorization Act.32 \\nSection 804 of the Authorization Act had given the Director of OST P, John P. \\nHoldren, two years to complete two tasks: first, to lay out a plan of action, in \\nthe event of an impending near-Earth object threat, to notify the relevant fed -\\neral agencies and emergency response institutions; and second, to recommend \\nthe appropriate agencies that should be responsible for “(A) protecting the \\n29.

Instead of remaining intact \\nuntil it exploded, and therefore depositing its explosive energy in a single point \\nin space (as bombs do) and generating a circular damage pattern on the sur -\\nface, the Chelyabinsk bolide’s breakup occurred gradually (relatively speak -\\ning), over about 4 seconds. So the actual damage pattern was more linear. In \\ntheir review of the incident, David Kring and Mark Boslough wrote that the \\npattern “looked more like an inclined cylindrical bow shock than a spherical \\nexplosion.”52 This was positive, in a sense. If the bolide had acted more like a \\nbomb, it would have done greater damage to a smaller area. This unexpected \\ndamage pattern was a result of the bolide having entered the atmosphere at \\na very low angle to the horizon.

Most of the questioning went to Holdren and Bolden and focused \\non two subject areas: what the NASA program was accomplishing in terms of \\nsurveys and characterization, and who was ultimately in charge of the nation’s \\nNEO preparations. As Representative Bill Posey (R-FL) put it:\\nNow, the Ranking Member [Rep.

(One was scheduled the \\nmonth following this hearing.) But neither Holdren nor Bolden would com -\\nmit to answering the who’s-in-charge-of-deflection question that was being \\nasked. Here the issue simply came down to this: who should be in charge \\ndepended on the nature of the threat. If a nuclear-based deflection campaign \\nneeded to be mounted, the U.S. Air Force might be a better choice; for a \\nkinetic deflection campaign, NASA might be. Policy-makers did not want to \\nmake this decision in the absence of a specific threat.\\nThis hearing highlighted an important non-asteroid context as well. In \\n2011, conflict between Congress and the administration over the mounting \\nfederal debt resulting from the Great Recession that had started in 2008 had \\nled to the initiation of automatic, across-the-board spending cuts in all fed -\\neral agencies known as “sequestration.”54 These cuts took effect in 2013. For \\nNASA, sequestration caused the Agency budget to shrink from $21 billion in \\n2010 to $18.4 billion in FY 2014, and members of Congress wanted to hear \\nhow this was impairing the NEO program.55 While Bolden (and General \\nShelton, who was having to furlough his civilian workforce) were frustrated \\nby the mindless sequestration cuts and were clear in telling the committee \\nmembers how they felt about those cuts, Bolden had to tell them it was not \\nreally affecting the NEO program. Despite sequestration, the administration \\nhad committed to expanding the NEO Observation Program’s budget from \\n$3.5 million in FY 2008 to $20.4 million in FY 2012 and to $40.5 million \\nin FY 2014.56 So the NEO Observations Program was getting an expanding \\npiece of a shrinking pie—though still not a very large piece in absolute terms.\\nThe rapidly increasing NEO program budget, finally, drew the attention \\nof NASA’s Inspector General (IG). At the time, Program Executive Lindley \\nJohnson was the only Headquarters employee dedicated to the program. He \\nhad no staff to help manage his $20.5 million budget (in FY 2013) and 64 \\nfunding instruments, or to help establish appropriate performance metrics for \\n54.

This initiative had been \\n14th on the prioritized list of activities for COPUOS to undertake, so the \\ncommittee established Action Team 14 to make recommendations to it.63\\nReflecting the relatively low priority of the issue, not much happened for \\nyears afterward. Somewhat in parallel, in 2005 Rusty Schweickart used the \\nplatform of the Association of Space Explorers (ASE), which had observer \\nstatus to COPUOS, to organize a Panel on Asteroid Threat Mitigation to \\ndevelop a “plan to draft a document on a NEO decision-making process.” In \\n2008, they delivered this document to Action Team 14. It contained three \\nprincipal recommendations: an Information, Analysis, and Warning Network \\nshould be established; a Mission Planning and Operations Group should be \\ncreated to assess existing deflection capabilities and develop plans in the event \\nof detected threats; and the United Nations should establish oversight of these \\nother two organizations through an intergovernmental Mission Authorization \\nand Oversight Group.64 The chair of Action Team 14, Sergio Camacho of \\nMexico, was also a member of Schweickart’s committee, so the report became \\na basis of discussion within the Action Team.\\nIn February 2013, Action Team 14 finally made its own recommenda -\\ntions to COPUOS. Two of its recommendations were quite similar to those of \\nSchweickart’s panel: that an International Asteroid Warning Network should \\nbe assembled out of the various organizations already doing that work and that \\na “space mission planning advisory group” should be developed. This differed \\nfrom the ASE proposal in being broader in scope, incorporating NEO-related \\nscience missions as well as potential future deflection missions. That way, the \\nplanning advisory group could serve a coordinating function for national sci -\\nence missions, too. But the third Action Team recommendation was quite dif -\\nferent: that an Impact Disaster Planning Advisory Group should be formed. \\nThis one, though, was rejected by the Scientific and Technical Subcommittee \\nof COPUOS.65 Ultimately, the two surviving recommendations were imple -\\nmented, with both new organizations being launched in 2014.\\n63.

Reporter Leonard David presented the Apophis case, commenting that \\nmany of his peers never quite understood that the projected risk had disap -\\npeared in a few days, and they also did not understand the keyhole issue \\nthat Apophis had introduced. “The media tend to feed off each other rather \\nthan to go to the few people who could legitimately inform them,” he said.\\n66 \\nLinda Billings, who served as a communications consultant for the Near-\\nEarth Objects Observations Program, reviewed the 2011 AG5 communi -\\ncations effort. She contended that official statements from ESA and NASA \\nwere “clear, concise, and correct…. The media predictably sensationalized the \\nrisk of impact. In much of the media coverage of 2011 AG5 from January \\n2011 to December 2012, sensational headlines led into stories that accurately explained knowledge about 2011 AG5.”\\n67\\nOne important recommendation from this meeting compelled NEO sci -\\nentists to develop a non-probabilistic means of communicating risk to the \\npublic. The Torino and Palermo scales might make sense to the statistically \\nsavvy, but perhaps not to the general public.

Only a handful of observations of it had been \\nmade, and the resulting orbit solution suggested that it would fly past Earth \\nwell within the orbit of the Moon. It would not be an impact risk, but uncer -\\ntainty in its orbit was still rather high.

These needed to be chosen in advance of an actual threat so that the various organizations and personnel involved would \\nbe working from the same playbook, minimizing public confusion. These \\ndecision criteria were agreed upon in 2017. IAWN agreed to make formal warnings of predicted impacts “exceeding a probability of 1% for all objects \\ncharacterized to be more than 10 meters in size.”\\n72 Preparedness planning \\nshould begin if an impact were predicted to occur within 20 years, by an object assessed to be greater than 20 meters in size, with a probability of \\nimpact greater than 10 percent. For its part, SMPAG should start mission option planning if an impact were to be predicted within 50 years, with an \\nimpactor size exceeding 50 meters and a probability greater than 1 percent.\\n73\\nAnother SMPAG activity was the discussion of “reference missions”—\\nconceptual deflection campaigns against various kinds of potential asteroid threats—and deflection test missions that were being funded by NASA and \\nESA. Both space agencies had funded conceptual studies over the previous decades and were pursuing a joint mission that was only loosely coupled. That \\nway, in the event that either ESA or NASA did not get funding for its part \\nof the mission, the other could continue. NASA chose a kinetic impactor test mission known as DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) to be developed \\nby the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, while ESA \\nwould send a later mission, the Asteroid Impact Mission (AIM), to evalu -\\nate the impactor’s effect on the target asteroid.

Their funding sources were both \\nmilitary and civil (Air Force and NASA), as well as private donations (most \\nnotably to Spacewatch and the Minor Planet Center).

Each time a NEO was found, it often generated public (and sometimes \\ncongressional) interest—especially if the object made, or was about to make, a \\nclose Earth approach. Although NASA was initially slow to take advantage of \\nthis interest, it did eventually generate increased funding for these efforts. The \\nadvancements of efficient CCD detectors and computer-driven observations \\nin the late 20th century dramatically accelerated the discovery rate, along \\nwith the number of known and upcoming close Earth approaches—thus gen -\\nerating more and more interest and more and more efforts to find the vast \\nmajority of those objects that could threaten Earth.\\nOnce discovered, NEOs require so-called follow-up positional observa -\\ntions that allow an accurate orbit determination so that the object’s future \\nmotion can be accurately predicted. In the last quarter of the 20th century, \\namateur astronomers were key to this effort, but the large-aperture, CCD-\\nbased surveys of today require professional astronomers with access to large \\ntelescopes to provide the follow-up observations that are most often too faint \\nfor amateur observers.\\nThe characterization of NEOs has also made impressive advances since the \\nefforts in the late 20th century to understand the physical and photometric \\ncharacteristics of NEOs.

In a subsequent letter to his son, the senior Burney sug -\\ngested the Greek word “aster” to denote “starlike,” and his son suggested that \\n“oid” be added to form “asteroid.” Herschel first used the term on 6\\xa0May 1802 \\nin his memoir presented to the Royal Society entitled “Observations of the \\nTwo Lately Discovered Celestial Bodies,” but his choice was not immediately \\ngreeted with great enthusiasm. Indeed, Herschel was accused of applying a \\nlesser designation for these objects so as not to detract from his own discovery \\nof the planet Uranus in 1781, and the English author John Corry even accused \\nHershel of “philosophical quackery.” Giuseppe Piazzi himself also rejected the \\nterm “asteroid,” perhaps because his pride would not allow his discovery to be \\nknown as anything other than a primary planet. Even so, by 1830, the term \\n“asteroid” was commonly used in England, and the American astronomer \\nBenjamin Apthorp Gould, founder of the Astronomical Journal in 1849, gave \\nthe term his stamp of approval in 1848.2 By the second half of the 19th cen -\\ntury, the term “minor planet” was often used instead of “asteroid.” Currently, \\nthe International Astronomical Union (IAU) and the Minor Planet Center \\n(MPC) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, use the term “minor planet,” but the \\ntwo terms are interchangeable, and both are widely used.\\nBy July 1851, there were only 15 discovered asteroids, few enough that \\nthey were usually listed along with the then-known planets. Fourteen of \\nthese asteroids had assigned symbols, but these symbols, meant to be shortcut \\ndesignations, were getting complicated and difficult to draw. For example, \\n1. Clifford J.

As a result, 878 Mildred, named after the daughter of \\nthe American astronomer Harlow Shapley, was lost until 1991, when Gareth \\nWilliams at the Minor Planet Center identified its few 1916 observations with \\nsingle-night observations made in 1985 and 1991.3\\nAsteroid numbers are sequentially assigned as their orbits are secured, and \\nthen they become eligible for naming. For the first few hundred asteroids \\ndiscovered, classical names were often assigned; thereafter, at least for a time, \\nnonclassical female names were often used. The first near-Earth object, 433 \\nEros, discovered in 1898, was an exception. Currently, asteroids are being \\nnamed for well-known, and not-so-well-known, scientists, personalities, \\ngeographic locations, and science contest award winners and their mentors, \\nalong with a host of other entities.

For a MOID of this size, planetary gravitational perturbations could \\nfurther decrease the MOID over several centuries, rendering the object truly, \\nrather than just potentially, hazardous. Often, the definition of a PHO (or \\nPHA for a potentially hazardous asteroid) includes the further restriction that \\nits absolute magnitude must be equal to or less than 22, which roughly limits \\nits diameter to 140 meters or larger. Based upon their orbital characteristics, \\nthere are four groups of near-Earth objects: the Amors, the Apollos, the Atens, \\nand the Atiras. This latter group is sometimes called the Inner-Earth objects, \\nor Apoheles.\\nAmors: Asteroids in this group have heliocentric orbits exterior to Earth’s but \\ngenerally interior to the orbit of Mars. An Amor-class asteroid’s perihelion \\ndistance (q) is greater than Earth’s aphelion distance (1.017 au). Amors are \\nalso near-Earth objects, so their perihelia are less than 1.3 au (q < 1.3 au). \\nHence, an asteroid is in the Amor class if its perihelion distance is between \\nthe values of 1.017 and 1.3 au. The namesake for this group is asteroid 1221 \\nAmor, which was discovered photographically on 12\\xa0March 1932 by Eugène \\nJoseph Delporte  in Uccle, Belgium. Amor is the Latin name for the Greek god \\nof love. Asteroid 433 Eros is an Amor object.\\nApollos:  Apollo-class asteroids are so-called Earth-crossers because they cross \\nover the heliocentric distance of Earth on their way to perihelion. Because of \\ntheir inclinations with respect to the ecliptic plane, their orbits do not neces -\\nsarily intersect Earth’s orbit. The perihelia of Apollos are less than Earth’s \\naphelion distance (q < 1.017 au), and their semimajor axes (a) are greater than \\n1.0\\xa0au. Apollos can cross the orbits of Mars, Earth, and Venus. The namesake \\nof this group is 1862 Apollo, named for the Greek god of the Sun, which was \\ndiscovered on 24 April 1932 during a photographic search for main-belt aster -\\noids by the German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at Heidelberg Observatory. \\nHowever, the 1932 observations covered less than a month, so the orbit was \\nnot well defined, or secured, and it was lost until it was observed again 41 years \\nlater on 28\\xa0March 1973 by the Oak Ridge Observatory in Massachusetts. As \\na result, 1862 Apollo has a higher number than some other so-called Apollo \\nasteroids, like 1566 Icarus and 1620 Geographos, which were discovered after \\nApollo but received enough observations to secure their orbits before the orbit \\nof Apollo could be secured in 1973.', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), Document(id_='7d8ac184-90a1-4503-957b-45d87d0310c5', embedding=None, metadata={'page_label': '323', 'file_name': 'a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_path': '/content/a_history_of_near-earth_object_research_tagged.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 4556385, 'creation_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_modified_date': '2023-12-25', 'last_accessed_date': '2023-12-25'}, excluded_embed_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], excluded_llm_metadata_keys=['file_name', 'file_type', 'file_size', 'creation_date', 'last_modified_date', 'last_accessed_date'], relationships={}, hash='918b9b90401f6886b596e5a2124d756835c4092fed3b667fd2bb5da03455a139', text='Appendix 2: Heliocentric Orbit Classifications for Near-Earth Objects 323\\nAtens:  The Aten-class asteroids are Earth-crossing, with their semimajor axes \\nless than that of Earth’s (a < 1.0 au) and their aphelia larger than Earth’s peri -\\nhelion (Q > 0.983 au).

Conway  has been the Jet Propulsion Laboratory’s (JPL’s) his -\\ntorian since 2004. He is the author of seven books, including Exploration \\nand Engineering: The Jet Propulsion Laboratory and the Quest for Mars;  High \\nSpeed Dreams: NASA and the Technopolitics of Supersonic Transportation; \\nand Atmospheric Science at NASA: A History . He served as an officer in the \\nUnited States Navy prior to completing a doctorate in the history of science \\nand\\xa0technology.\\nDr. Donald K. Yeomans  was a JPL fellow and senior research scientist prior \\nto his retirement in 2015. From 1998 through early 2015, he was the man -\\nager of NASA’s Near-Earth Object Program Office at JPL. He provided the \\naccurate predictions that led to the telescopic recovery of Comet Halley at \\nPalomar Observatory on 16 October 1982 and allowed the recognition of \\n164 BCE Babylonian observations of Comet Halley on clay tablets in the \\nBritish Museum. He was a Science Team member for NASA’s Near Earth \\nAsteroid Rendezvous (NEAR) mission, for NASA’s Deep Impact mission, \\nand for the Japanese Hayabusa mission. Asteroid 2956 was renamed asteroid \\n2956 Yeomans to honor his professional achievements, and in 2013, he was \\nnamed as one of the 100 most influential persons by Time  magazine.\\nDr. Meg Rosenburg  received her Ph.D. in planetary geophysics, with addi -\\ntional specialization in the history of science, from the California Institute \\nof Technology in 2014, focusing on the interpretation of cratered terrains, \\nparticularly the lunar surface.

That event reflected a growing interest in, and concern \\nabout, the threat of celestial impacts. In ancient times, the solar system’s \\nsmall bodies—asteroids and comets—were sometimes seen as ill omens, \\nwarnings from the gods. In modern times, they have come to be seen \\nas the solar system’s rubble, leftovers from its formation, but still largely \\nignored until the late 20th century. Increasingly, they have been seen by \\nscientists as objects worthy of study; by the general public, and the U.S. \\ngovernment, as potential threats to be mitigated; and by space advocates \\nas future resources.
